# Development Practices

Questions about coding techniques, testing, debugging, refactoring, and maintaining high-quality code.

## When Should You Perform A Major Refactor?

I am not a big fan of major refactors as a rule.

I usually find that the core issues in the code can
be fixed by "boyscouting" the issues you have in each
delivery. By doing so you fix the mindset of the developers
and you don't have to stop feature development.
Too often I see developers cry for big refactors and yet
those same developers never even try to fix smaller things
that they could fix easily.

However, let us assume that we do have a good set of developers
who really do their best to boyscout code. In this scenario, I
find that major refactors are needed when the overall architecture
is wrong. An example of this would be that the data model is not right
for the domain.
If the data being stored is not a good reflection of the domain, all
other logic has to account for it, which usually causes bad workarounds
and bugs.
As many professional developers know, changing a database schema for
a large domain has many challenges and it is hard to do it little by
little. Especially if you can't do something simple like a batch schema
update by taking down the system for some maintenance.
There are of course alternatives to this approach but I think it is
a good example of a task that is easiest done by a big one time investment
that may be worth doing instead of dragging it out with the boyscouting
approach.

In short, big refactors should not be your first thought. Your first
thought should be to ponder if you can create a plan with your team.
That plan should consider if you can make small changes in each delivery
that over time will solve your problem. It is a bit like a fitness
schedule. You just need to stick to the plan and you will lose legacy
code.
If however, you find an obstacle where there is no way to boyscout,
it is after all very hard to boyscout a database schema, then you
may want to consider a big refactor.

## How To Write Integration Tests That Aren’t Flaky?

The best way I know, is to write integration tests that
can run in a stable environment and with stable values.
Flaky behaviour usually comes from things like race conditions
and unrealiable systems external to your code.

Take time as an example. Timestamps are a common thing in many
programs and they can be hard to write tests for. The tricky
part about writing tests for timestamps is usually that time
keeps changing. So how do we fix that? Well, the simplest way
is to not do exact assertions on timestamps and instead allow
for a small amount of error margin so the test won't fail if
the difference between two timestamps is just a few milliseconds.

Another worthwile consideration is for functions using time internally.
Instead of creating a timestamp inside the function, pass it as a parameter
so the caller can control the time value. If your langauge supports
default parameters, I find it nice to use a default value so the test
can override it when needed.

When we are dealing with external system, it is in general a good practice
to remove unstable elements by mocking network calls we may not need.
However, we must take care when mocking so we don't end up mocking
away the code we want to test.
In some cases we don't want to mock and instead we want to create
a local setup that we can run. A good example are databases. We want
to make sure that our queries to the database are working but we don't
want to connect to external services. So what to do?
My person preference, and I assume many others, is to use a local
database that starts up with the tests and is then shut down after
the tests are done running. Even though this is not a perfect test
that accounts for the things that could be wrong in a production
environment, it is still close enough.
Sometimes close enough is the better option to pick than having to
deal with the problems that come with exactly the same.

## Are Unit Tests Effective As Regression Test Suites?

In of themselves, no. Combined with the layers commonly found on a
testing pyramid, yes.

I often see developers struggling to understand testing. They write
some basic unit tests and call it a day. However, I argue that if
you don't understand that the test you write depends on the code,
then you haven't really understood why you are writing tests.

Unit tests make a lot of sense to write if you are afraid that the
function you have made will have a bug in it. They make no sense
at all if the function isn't doing anything that can go wrong.
They make no sense if the code you have is just connecting to an
external API to fetch some data. We can of course make an argument
for that checking the url or possible input parameters being added
to the request body can be a unit test but I hope we can agree that
the most risky part of an external API call is that the API returns
the wrong data.
Testing that is best done with an integration test since we want to
be sure that the request actually works.

Always focus on what can go wrong when making tests. Having unit tests
does not mean that bugs will be caught. Having the right test for the
code you have made will.

## Why Do Seniors Sometimes Use Complex Code Instead Of Simple Code?

The two main reasons is usually that either, it is just the way
they feel at the moment or there is no simpler way to do it.

Senior developers are like most of us, human. Humans get bored, they
forget that what to them is a cool idea is legacy code to the next
developer who has to fix their mess.
Ponder yourself how often you see people getting excited by their
amazing idea and in their excitment they forget to consider if
their idea will have any negative impact on others around them.
Seniors are no different.

On the off-chance that we do have a valid case for some complex
code, however we want to define that. I am just going to point
out that complex is a bit subjective and can mean literally
anything. What we consider complex can differ vastly from person
to person but in general, complex code may be the lesser evil
at times.
At times we simply find that a complex solution is the best way
to solve a given problem. As an example, searching. Depending on
what type of search our customer wants to perform, we may find
that we need multiple types of result filters, different type of
boolean flags that impact how the search is performed and so on.
Simply put, a beginner friendly regular expression or string
comparison will not be enough to meet the stakeholders needs.
So we have to make our code complex, even if we would like it to
be simpler.

A good rule to follow, make code as complex at it has to be but
never more.

## What Techniques Can Help Simplify Code?

My personal mantra is to divide and conquer. If we are dealing
with a big problem our best bet is usually to split it in to
many smaller problems and then order each piece as a step by
step process. This allows us to focus on getting the first step
in our program right before we need to think about the next part.

My functional friends can hopefully relate when I say that I would
love it if all my coworkers structured their code as a list of pure
functions that I can follow until I find an unexpected output from
one of them. This means that now I can forget about most of the code
and just zero in on that function.

I follow the same principle when I am debugging. My first goal
is to remove all factors that can cause the bug. If I am working
with an IDE, use a text editor to make sure the problem is not in
the IDE. If I am getting an error while using the UI, try connecting
with a network client. Having problems in a environment? Try locally
and vice versa.

As you work you will develop an intuition for how to divide big issues
in to smaller ones and before you know it, you find it odd that most
people just see big problems when all you see is a simple first step
that then leads to a simple next step.

## Does “if It Isn’t Broken, Don’t Fix It” Apply To Software?

Yes, very much so. Though as with many sayings, there are
nuances that get lost in translation.

There is a lot of development that happens mostly due to the
emotions of whoever is involved. The term legacy code can often
mean any code that the reader didn't write in their own style.
So I usually ask them, is the code bad because it is different
or will it actually cause any bugs? Viewed from such a perspective
our idea of what good code and bad code looks like should change.
We love to put those labels on most things in life but if we are
really honest, most of the time we are just expressing what we
would prefer.

However, we can of course flip this argument around and use this
saying to justify never fixing anything in our code. This seems to
many to be the default state of their stakeholders. If the code is
working, why do you need to refactor? Well dear sir or madam.
Because working on this projects is just slightly better than
listening to someone grind a fork against a chalkboard. When I push
something to production, I feel the need to say a small prayer to
any diety willing to listen. Lastly, all those late nights I have had
to wake up to fix production issues are starting to wear me down so
perhaps we can discuss what you mean when you say that the system
isn't broken.

## Do Coding Best Practices Vary Between Companies?

Yes, sometimes it differs between person to person.

Best practice is something some developers like to
throw behind any argument they pitch for their own
preffered way of doing something.
There are certainly best practices that most of us can
agree on but there are also best practices that seem to be
directly opposing eachother.

Then we have to interpretation of these best practices.
How do we know who among us has the right idea of what
DRY means? If you ask a room of developers to define
this practice, most of them will be able to give some
general deffinition. However, if we start going in to
the nitty gritty details, usually they start having
different ideas about how to implement this practice
in code. Let alone when the adherance to this practice
becomes a code smell instead of a best practice.

The best advice I have ever heard on the subject is
as follows. The tech gurus are not in your team,
they are not writing your code. Your coworkers are.
Winning a battle of who has the right idea of what a
best practice means is useless if your end up getting
fired because people are sick of endless debates about
best practices.

## How To Prevent Bugs In Software Development?

This is a very broad topic since bugs can happen
in many ways. I will try my best to outline a few
general techniques I use that I feel are working.

First, learn how to write the right test for your
code.

Second, learn how to break free from primitives.

Most developers learn how to write code in the
style taught by their very first tutorials but
they seem to never outgrow this idea that the
style they used to learn how to code, may not
be the best way to write code always.

To give an example, let us consider the following
code.

![controller](../assets/user_controller.png)

Now, glossing over the security issues with this
code, we can see that it follows a general pattern
we all have seen in many codebases. It is simple,
we get a value from the network and we store it.
However, the problem here is that we are not sure
if the values are valid.

Now let us introduce some basic validation.

![validated](../assets/validate_user_controller.png)

Again, nothing really wrong with this approach.
However, if we start introducing more logic with multiple
calls to various functions across a large codebase, we will
start to see misstakes being made. One of the most common bugs
I have faced is i.e down to the data being incorrect at some
state of the program. We can remove a lot of issues if we update
this code slightly.

![class](../assets/class_user_controller.png)

If we convert our input data to a class, we can trust that our data
is already validated by the time any other logic wants to use it.
This removes the issue where the data is in an incorrect state before
we start working with it.

This slight change in coding style has helped me remove a large amount
of bugs from my projects. Even if I am passing the data around I can
always trust the data in a validated class.
Primitives do not give this security and most developers try to
fix it by simply adding validation in all the functions using the data.
This approach is in my opinion, a bit cleaner.

## Can Automated Testing Replace Code Reviews?

No, code reviews are a compliment to tests.

The basic idea behind a code review is that we want
someone other than ourselves to review our code for
issue we have failed to spot. In theory that is how
it should work but in practice the value of a code
review is down to who is doing it, if they care enough
to do a thourough review and of course, if they can spot
issues we did not.

If I write code and then test it, I will approach it from
an angle that makes sense to me. However, I can still forget
to write tests for cases that can cause bugs or I can write
bad tests that don't catch the bugs. This is where a second
pair of eyes will be more useful than just having tests. Those
eyes should hopefully be able to spot that I forget to test
my code for certain cases, thus prompting me to expand my
thinking and adding the tests I forgot.

It is also common that a code reviewer finds that I may have
missunderstood the acceptance criteria for the work I am doing
and that my whole implementation is wrong. It is not fun to be
in that situation but I hope it proves that automated tests can
test that the thing I did is working as expected. It can not prove
that the thing I did is the right thing.
