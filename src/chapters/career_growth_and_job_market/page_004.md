## How to Determine If a Company Follows Good Software Practices?

It is very hard to do this accurately because everyone things differently
about what good practices are. Even if you ask a manager if they do
testing and they say that they do, you have no way of knowing to what
extent or if the company developers are any good at it.

My trick is to ask this simple question in the interview.
"Can you tell me what tools the developers use to ship code?"

By asking this and listening to what stack is being used,
what infrastructure they use, what surrounding services
are in play, I can tell based on experience roughly
how the work is done.
This does not mean that I know what the state of the code
is but it gives me a rough idea of what it will be like
to work in the company.

What I am listening for is if the tools and practices
the company uses are similar to what other companies
are using and to what extent they are familiar with
modern practices.
If I hear that they follow similar setups to what most
companies are, I can feel comfortable in that at the
very least there is nothing too out there going on.
However, if I hear that they have a lot of strong
opinions or use uncommon solutions I will be a bit
more careful. I usually ask followup questions as
the interviewer explains so I can clarify things
I am unsure about.

This is by no means a perfect strategy but it is
so far the best one I have. Sadly it is built on
having the needed experience to know what it means
practically when a company uses a given setup.
If you know what is common in project when different
tools and practices are in play you can almost predict
what the code looks like and how the regular week looks.

## What About Job Hopping?

This is a personal choice developers have to make. Rather than making
an argument for or against job hopping, I would rather give the advice
of being deliberate with your choices so they align with your own goals.

There is no guarantee that you will get promoted by being loyal to
a company. However, there is neither any chance for you to build
up a career if you never commit long enough to gain what truly matters.
Experience, that is the gold standard of what gives you market value
and it is what will give you the best chance to find the job you want.

No one will reward you for working in a company for decades if that
work does not convert in to experience you can bring with you.
What I argue is that you should consider what type of career you want
and if climbing the ladder is important to you, use each job as a way
to gain experience.
When you feel that you are ready to take the next step, communicate
it to your manager and see what options they give you.

I have always used a simple strategy to determine if I should switch
job or stay at the same job. I consider if the prospects I have at
my job are better than what I could find in another company.
I try to act with transparency and honesty with my managers so that
they get an honest chance to consider if they want to keep me by
giving me what I ask for. I hold nothing against them if they can't
give me the opportunities I am looking for. I simply apply for
the role I want in another company.

This strategy is no more complex than how I do my shopping. I have
a need for something, I look at what the market has to offer and
go with the option that I feel is best for the moment. Should I
later feel differently I do the same thing again.

What in practice then happen is that I will either get what I ask for
from my current employer or someone else will give me a better offer.
Often I have found that once another offer is on the table and I am
about to move on, my current employer feels more incentive to meet
my request so I will stay.

I believe that if you think in terms of trying to put your time in
to roles where there is mutual benefit you will find the sweet spot.
You will stay at a job that gets you closer to your goal without
becoming so attached that you hurt your own prosperity and growth.

I always speak honestly and softly to my managers about my views on
my role within the company. I will gladly put my heart and soul in
to everything I do. All I ask in return is that they do their best
to help me reach my personal goals.
