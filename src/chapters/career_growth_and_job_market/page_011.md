## What Are The Most Common Mistakes Developers Make Early On?

- Taking a job that does not grow them
- Thinking that tech gurus are always right
- Ignoring their CV
- Not experimenting

First, it is important that we acknowledge how easy it is to say
that someone should choose work that helps them grown. However,
not all of us are blessed with the same choices as those who
are fortunate enough to find work that benefits them in this manner.
Although it may not be an option try your best to make finding
work that helps you grown your skills a priority. Investing
in yourself is almost always a good idea and it pays off
when you want to take a step up in your career or maybe even
try out different companies. Skills are what matter most so
make sure you work with projects that help you grow them.

One major mistake a lot of developer make, this one included,
is to forget that just because something is popular does not
mean that it is a good idea for your situation.
It is a bit like buying a fancy coffee machine that everyone
who is a true coffee lover swears by. If you love coffee so
much that this machine will fit your needs then go for it
but if you are fine with any arbitrary instant coffee it
may be the wrong choice. Gurus and tech trends work the same
way. As a developer you should keep an eye out for what is going
on in the community but always remember to ask if you really need
to follow a piece of advice before you end up making choices
that would be perfect for someone else but for you just end up
being a lot of waste. Less is more, as a good rule of thumb.

Once you have mastered the coding you should not forget to
keep your CV up to date. It doesn't hurt to have a professional
network as well. As many who have talent or are selling something
great will tell you, having something others will benefit from is
just half of the problem, the rest is making them realize it.
Having a good career is not just about having skills it is also
about showcasing those skills to the right people. Those people
who see your value may help you get the next role or invite other
opportunities that will benefit you. Make sure that there is proof
of the great work you have done and that others can see it.

Lastly, remember to try out different styles of coding and different
types of tool. Just for fun. You will learn much from tinkering
with trend tools or getting inspiration from trying out a different
programming language. You don't have to do big projects but your
understanding of the craft will grow by a lot if you expose your
mind to how different people have tried solving issues that you
yourself may have in your work. I have found that by tinkering
with small projects from time to time has helped me a great deal
in getting better at coming up with solutions to various problems
in my work.

# How To Navigate Decision-making In Tech Teams?

I refer to my approach as an "Expert democracy".
I know that I am almost always right about all my great ideas
but sadly, in their delusions of grandeur, my "peers" think
the same. While I internally curse their arrogance to question
me, I sadly have to admit that it won't look good for me if
I try to lay down the law.

Luckily enough, most developers are rational people so I suggest
that we have a good old fashion argument. This is why soft skills
become increasingly important for your career. You quickly learn
that if you want the right stack or the right work situation you
need to get people to listen to you before you get to use your
coding skills for anything meaningful.

Once we have argued our point we weigh the experience level and
relevance of knowledge in the group. This means that the voice
of whoever makes the best argument and has the most experience
usually gets the most traction on their viewpoint.

Finally we vote and regardless of if we agree or not we always
try to structure our decision so we can start small and scale up
if it is a new concept we introduce. If it is a different way
of working, we hate our peers internally for forcing us to write
code in some bs way while lamenting their stupidity. Often
while trying to take a calming bath.

## How To Deal With Engineers Seeking Promotions Too Soon?

I have always favoured a merit based approach in matters that
involve authority and compensation. In my view the only
case where we can consider a promotion to come too early
is if we lack the needed history to determine if the developer
has the needed skills to handle the new role.

If the developer in question has no proof of their ability to
handle a new promotion I find that simply speaking to them
about the role they seek and what that role will require is
enough to make them ponder if they do in fact have the skills
needed. Usually I suggest that the developer and the manager
agree on a set of activities that can act as evaluation examples
of the developer so they have a honest chance to prove that they
are able to handle the role.

Companies tend to treat the matter of promotion a bit different
than I would like and it is not uncommon that there is in fact
no plan for how to deal with the subject. This is why I suggest
that any company that intends to provide career development to
their developer have some idea of how to evaluate the developers
who want to progress. More often than not I have found that
moving away from old models where the company only promotes
people based on their time spent in the company or by how
important their role has been is a good first step.

The model I have found to work best is to treat the promotion just
as hiring a new candidate. Figure out what roles you have need of
and don't promote people unless you truly need the role. When
you have the need, figure out how you would evaluate a new hire
for the position and allow the developers seeking the promotion
to be evaluated in the same manner. This has the benefit of being
a less biased way of staffing and it raises up the people who
can show that they have the right skills needed to do well in
a given role.
