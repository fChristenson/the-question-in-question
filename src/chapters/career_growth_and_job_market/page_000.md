# Career Growth and Job Market

## Have You Ever Needed to Prove Yourself as a Developer?

Yes, almost everyday.
I reached a point where my confidence grew enough but it took years.

It is common for developers to feel insecure.
Everything from how fast they deliver to how good their solutions is.
God forbid that you cause a serious bug.

In the beginning of my career I felt the need to prove myself often.
It was to a point where it was about all I thought about.
At least while my mind was unoccupied.

People handle these sorts of insecurities differently.
I know senior developers who still feel this way.
It is hard to say if it ever truly goes away for everyone.

For me however the insecurities became easier to handle.
I started to notice that my skills were good enough to meet expectations.
As I could deliver easier and faster. They melted away.

Try your best to raise your skills.
When you see that you can deliver, note it and think about it.
Realize that you are now good enough to do this job, so be glad.

## How to Overcome Insecurities as a Junior Developer?

Start by understanding that you are new to development.
It will take time to get good at it. There are no shortcuts.

You will be slow. You will cause bugs. You will feel dumb.
Nothing you do can make the journey easier.
However, you can own that you are new.

Be transparent and honest about where you are in your career.
You will become great with time but right now you need practice.
Get secure enough to admit that you are new to others and yourself.

Find coping mechanisms for the days when everything fails.
And then.
Do. Not. Give. Up.

## What factors contribute to developer rejection in interviews?

If the company has a coding test and you pass it things are from
that point on mostly about what feeling people get from you.

The most valuable thing you can do in a personal interview are 2 things.

First. Prove that you care about the work.

Tell them about the projects you have on the side.
Tell them about the tools you are checking out right now.
Tell them about what trends you are looking at.
Prove that you care about good code.

Second. Be likeable.

You want to show that you are someone who they can work with.
You want to show that you will listen when taught.
You want to show that you will communicate well with others.
Turn up your positivity 40% and remember to smile.

Getting rejected in the interview is almost always
due to these 2 things missing.
Try to make them leave the interview with a good gut feeling.

## How to Add New Technology to Your CV?

As a rule of thumb, make sure you have understood how to use it for
the most common cases.

It is a bit like claiming that you know a spoken language.
If you can communicate decently people will agree that you know it
to some extent.

However, if you can barely make yourself understood you lack the
needed proficiency to have any value from the language.

Your CV should reflect the tools you know well enough to do the
common tasks. You do not have to be a master.
You just have to be able to produce something useful with them.

A good example is learning a new web language. If you know how to
produce an API and hook it up with a database you are in the ballpark
of what is considered useful knowledge.

Frontend is similar. Can you ship a mobile first UI that fetches
some data to display? Good, put it on the CV.
