# Career Growth and Job Market

## Have You Ever Needed to Prove Yourself as a Developer?

Yes, almost everyday.

I reached a point where my confidence grew enough but it took years.

It is common for developers to feel insecure.

Everything from how fast they deliver to how good their solutions is.

God forbid that you cause a serious bug.

In the beginning of my career I felt the need to prove myself often.

It was to a point where it was about all I thought about.

At least while my mind was unoccupied.

People handle these sorts of insecurities differently.

I know senior developers who still feel this way.

It is hard to say if it ever truly goes away for everyone.

For me however the insecurities became easier to handle.

I started to notice that my skills were good enough to meet expectations.

As I could deliver easier and faster. They melted away.

Try your best to raise your skills.

When you see that you can deliver, note it and think about it.

Realize that you are now good enough to do this job, so be glad.
