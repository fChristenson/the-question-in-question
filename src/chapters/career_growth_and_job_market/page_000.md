# Career Growth and Job Market

## Have You Ever Needed to Prove Yourself as a Developer?

Yes, almost everyday.
I reached a point where my confidence grew enough but it took years.

It is common for developers to feel insecure.
Everything from how fast they deliver to how good their solutions is.
God forbid that you cause a serious bug.

In the beginning of my career I felt the need to prove myself often.
It was to a point where it was about all I thought about.
At least while my mind was unoccupied.

People handle these sorts of insecurities differently.
I know senior developers who still feel this way.
It is hard to say if it ever truly goes away for everyone.

For me however the insecurities became easier to handle.
I started to notice that my skills were good enough to meet expectations.
As I could deliver easier and faster. They melted away.

Try your best to raise your skills.
When you see that you can deliver, note it and think about it.
Realize that you are now good enough to do this job, so be glad.

## How to Overcome Insecurities as a Junior Developer?

Start by understanding that you are new to development.
It will take time to get good at it. There are no shortcuts.

You will be slow. You will cause bugs. You will feel dumb.
Nothing you do can make the journey easier.
However, you can own that you are new.

Be transparent and honest about where you are in your career.
You will become great with time but right now you need practice.
Get secure enough to admit that you are new to others and yourself.

Find coping mechanisms for the days when everything fails.
And then.
Do. Not. Give. Up.

## What factors contribute to developer rejection in interviews?

If the company has a coding test and you pass it things are from
that point on mostly about what feeling people get from you.

The most valuable thing you can do in a personal interview are 2 things.

First. Prove that you care about the work.

Tell them about the projects you have on the side.
Tell them about the tools you are checking out right now.
Tell them about what trends you are looking at.
Prove that you care about good code.

Second. Be likeable.

You want to show that you are someone who they can work with.
You want to show that you will listen when taught.
You want to show that you will communicate well with others.
Turn up your positivity 40% and remember to smile.

Getting rejected in the interview is almost always
due to these 2 things missing.
Try to make them leave the interview with a good gut feeling.

## How to Add New Technology to Your CV?

As a rule of thumb, make sure you have understood how to use it for
the most common cases.

It is a bit like claiming that you know a spoken language.
If you can communicate decently people will agree that you know it
to some extent.

However, if you can barely make yourself understood you lack the
needed proficiency to have any value from the language.

Your CV should reflect the tools you know well enough to do the
common tasks. You do not have to be a master.
You just have to be able to produce something useful with them.

A good example is learning a new web language. If you know how to
produce an API and hook it up with a database you are in the ballpark
of what is considered useful knowledge.

Frontend is similar. Can you ship a mobile first UI that fetches
some data to display? Good, put it on the CV.

## How Can Developers Navigate Promotions And Career Transitions?

As a rule you can expect that promotions comes in two ways.

Either the company has a need for it and you happen to be picked
or you ask for it.

The key thing to understand about promotions is that they are not
always possible. You may be in a company where there is not path
to a promotion for you.

Start by bringing it up with your manager and see what they say.
If you find that they are open to it you now need to know something.
It may never happen even if they say that they will help.

Most companies have a clear strategy for hiring new people
but few have as clear a strategy for promotions.

My personal tip for you is to set a personal deadline. Decide
that you will look for other opportunities while waiting.
Often you will find that the path to a promotion is tougher
than getting a new job. This is mainly due to that companies
think differently about promotions and hiring.

When hiring, managers tend to look at candidates with a limited context.
They go by the gut feeling and CV but when promoting they tend
to think differently. Usually they will look to you for proof
that you should get promoted and that can get tricky to provide.
It can get even more tricky to convince them that your proof
is enough for a promotion.

If you find another job it is very common that the company
offers you benefits to stay. Now that you are about to go they need
to keep you if you are a real asset.

What has just happened is that you have switched the
power dynamic and forced them to take action instead
of waiting for them to have time to make you a priority
or being strung along to provide proof that may or may
not be possible to get.

## How Long Does It Typically Take To Advance From Junior to Senior?

The industry has a lot of varying opinions on what it means to be
a senior. The range that is most common is between 4 - 8 years
of work experience.

It is important to know that the title senior is just an indicator
and you can find that in one company they call you senior but
in another they think differently. Managers differ in opinion
on this topic so don't overthink it too much and be very
careful when someone claims to know what being a senior means.
No one will be able to tell you a version that the industry can
agree on fully.

## What Are Your Thoughts on Bootcamp Graduates?

It is good for soon to be developers to know that Bootcamp
certificates of completion may not weigh as heavily as
a college degree or similar.

The reason behind it is usually that some companies view
degree's as a more serious education. This prejudice is
luckily not so widespread that it should discourage developers
who feel a Bootcamp is more their style.

At the end of the day what will matter is your skill and
once you have work experience almost no one will care
what degree you have. Degrees are what you use to get
in to the industry and once you are in they lose
most of their meaning.

## What Steps Should Developers Take After Being Laid Off?

I think about job security as being in a survival situation.
Most out-doors enthusiast will tell you that the key to survival
is to be prepared.

In the woods being prepared means things like having shelter
and a water source. In software development it means something different.

Survival tips for software developers are as follows:

- Keep your CV up to date.
- Make sure your CV is easy to find on the web.
- Front the most relevant tools you know on the CV.
- Connect with people on social media.
- Keep up to date with the trends in the trade.
- Practice how to do well in interviews.
- Save enough money to make it through to the next job.

These tips should be practiced before you get laid off.

Once you are out of a job your first move should be to
look at the job postings in your region. I can also
recommend to post a pleasant message on your social
media accounts where you briefly mentions what your
main stack is, how much experience you have and
how to get in touch with you.

## Would You Accept a Position That Down-Levels Your Role?

Personally I would. At this point I have done enough as a software
developer to know how to do decently in any role.

The role is from my point of view just a label that carries
certain responsibilities with it. What matters to me however
is if I enjoy what I do.

Being a principal engineer in a big corporation and then
taking the CTO role in a small startup may seem like a
step up but the practical tasks will often be the same.

Once you learn what you need to hold down most jobs
it really is only you who determines what you would enjoy.
I enjoy engaging work so as long as I am happy with my salary
and my daily routine feels engaging then I don't care what
my title is. The title only really matters when you are trying
to determine who has final say or when you are trying to pad
your CV with things that seem impressive to a new employer.

## Why Do IT Companies Ask If You Were at the Top of Your Class?

When companies hire new developers they leave that task to managers
who don't really know what software development is about.
What they will do is to look at what other companies are doing
for inspiration and they will guess what they believe are signs
of a good developer.

When interviewers ask about your grades, how many side projects
you have and so on. All they want is for you to prove that you
are good at what you do. They want to feel comfortable in that
if they hire you then you will learn fast and be a good fit
for their company.

You can prove this in many ways and even if you didn't make it
to the top of your class you can simply mention that you
made up for it by having side projects or other activities
that prove that you like what you do and that you care about
making good code.

## What Strategies Help Developers Manage Unrealistic Deadlines?

I usually advocate that you ask yourself why you fear a deadline.
Deadlines regardless if they are realistic or unrealistic make
many developers feel nervous so try to understand why you feel
that way.

What I have found is that problems can only be solved by doing
one of two things. Either you simplify the problem or you increase
your capacity for solving the problem.

If your managers sets and unrealistic deadline they fail to understand
this simple truth and more often than not their reason for the
deadline is not that if they fail to meet it something bad will happen
but rather they want to move fast enough to meet some expectation.
This is mean nothing practical for you other than that you will be
part of a missed deadline and if you are ok with that emotionally
you don't need to be bothered by it.

The main tip I can give you is to avoid giving false promises
to your stakeholders and try to be realistic. If your managers
still feels that a sharper deadline is needed let them decide on
it. It really makes no difference other than the emotional impact
it has on the people involved. Keep working and see if you meet
the deadline or not. If you are about to fail you calmly explain
to the manager that you either need to ship less features or
you need more resources. Faster developers could also be an option
but that will likely take a lot longer than simply adding more
people, shipping less code or simply extending the deadline.

I like to think about a software team as a car. If you have
an average car and you think that by just really wanting to
win in a formula one race your going to be able to do it.
Well you are not being realistic I would argue. Winning a
race or shipping good code on time both require you to have
the right people and the right conditions before it is time
to deliver.

## How Would You Improve The Interview Process?

It is common that developers find interview tedious or intimidating.

I usually advocate that companies structure their process with
a few guidelines. Though even doing so will probably never make
the process enjoyable to candidates but it may make it more tolerable.

Start by making a code test that takes no longer than an hour or two
to complete. The goal of a code test should be to verify that a candidate
has basic coding knowledge. The more complex you make it the more likely
you are to make life tough on the candidates.

Once you have a code test verify that it is possible for a junior
level developer to complete it. When you review a code test you will
notice if the test is barely passing or if the candidate has added
their own ideas on top. This indicates seniority.

Next, design a standard set of questions that ask about specific
practices and tools relevant to the role the candidate will have.
Ask developers about how features in their tools work and when they
pick one approach over another.
These sorts of questions allows the candidate to answer at their level.
From a junior level you will get answers that are fairly shallow in
their depth and from seniors you will be able to hear their experience
based on the depth of the answer they give.

This approach of asking questions makes it easy to avoid getting too
high level and focus on the practicals of delivering software.
This is very useful when you have candidates who tend to talk forever
about the first questions and before you know it your out of time
and you have no idea if they know how to code at all.

With these two methods of evaluation I usually suggest you ask how
much time you have. If you have a lot of time for interviews you can
go directly to the personal interview. The seniors usually prefer this
and it is by far the easiest way to figure out their level. If they
do well and you have faith that the people doing the interview are
experienced software developers who can tell who will be a good fit
and who will not, skip the test.
However, if you are dealing with large amounts of candidates or junior
developer you will usually be better off starting with the test.
It will screen out candidates who can't handle the basics.

Make sure that you always have the evaluation of the interview done
by your best and brightest developers. They need some social graces
as well so they can make the process comfortable for the candidate.
This is my personal process for interview and although it is not perfect
it is as fair as I can make it right now.

## Can Non-Passionate Developers Have Successful Careers?

Yes. Most developers are not particularly passionate about the craft.
It is a common misconception that in order to be a software developer
you need to spend a lot of time outside of work. This is true in some
cases and it is usually in the early days when you struggle to produce
working code.
However it is by no means a requirement to be up to date on all
the trends and have your own projects.

When you are a developer the things that matters is that you can
deliver code using the tools your company uses. If you manage to learn
all you need on the job then you won't need to push harder unless you
want to.
However if you are struggling to meet expectations or you find it hard
to find a new job due to that you lack knowledge. Well, then you will
need to make up the difference in your spare time most likely.

The people who are truly passionate have a lifestyle that is not for
everyone. These are the people you see on social media and conferences.
Try to remember that for every one of them there is an audience of
people who are not on stage. These people are the norm and most of
the industry is made up of people who develop software as a job but
in their spare time they may have any range of other interests.
