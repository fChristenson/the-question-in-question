## What Are The Challenges Of Onboarding Developers In Complex Projects?

Usually their productivity is the main factor. Complex projects often
require the developers to have a lot of upfront knowledge before they
can confidently work. That naturally brings the second main issue.
When developers have a hard time following the architecture of the
system, they make mistakes. These can range from minor bugs to the
wrong design decisions for the system.

I have found that to combat these issues your best bet will be to
foster a culture on engagement in the team. Hire people with strong
communication skills and encourage them to interact with the stakeholders
so they learn what they are building and for who. Too often I see
projects become a big mess because the developers have a hard time
understanding the needs of the people using the system and as you
can imagine, the more complex the system the easier it is to make
poor choices when coding.
Good developers always know what they are making, for who and why
it has to work a certain way. If you have developers who know when
to stop and evaluate if they are making the right choices, then
you have people you can rely on even if the system is complex.

## What Are The Top 1% Of Software Engineers Doing Differently?

Sadly I don't know any top 1% developers on a global scale. I am
not even sure how we would measure it. But I do know the top 1%,
at least in my opinion, in a range of teams and companies.

The red thread between all the people I would call top 1% is,
at least from my viewpoint, that they pair strong technical skills
with a good understanding of what they are making, for who and
what results their customers are hoping to get.

The reason this is so powerful is that if you only have strong
tech skills, you may write great code but you will usually not
create the right code for the situation. The best way I can
describe it is that, imagine that you go to a blacksmith to
buy a knife and after a bit of waiting he hands you a sword.
Sure, it is a nice sword and proof of this mans amazing skill
but it is the wrong result. Great craftsmen know how to use
their skills to produce the best result for the customer.
Sometimes that means making a really great knife and sometimes
it means making a sword but they are always focused on getting
the results that the customer wants.

By understanding the desired result of the customer we can
predict how we need to structure the code so it best fits
the results we want. What the top 1% does after that is to
stop before they do exactly what the specification tells
them and start thinking for themselves. They understand
that the customer has just tried to express what they
want but they may not know that there are better ways
to get the results they want. The top 1% then connect with
the customer and present a few options worth considering.

In summary, top developers have strong tech skills and
a product mindset. They understand that the code they
write is going to become a solution to someones problem
and it is vital to understand that person so the end
result becomes great.

## Does Your Job Title Impact Your Results?

To some extent yes. Titles paired with mannerisms have a big impact
on how other people perceive you and that has an impact on if they
will listen to you or not. This is a key insight you will learn when
you start suggesting how to improve the system you are working on.
If you try to get a junior developer to pitch that a refactor is needed
to the stakeholders, it may be hard to get traction. The junior may
be completely correct but if they can't give the stakeholders a feeling
of trust and comfort, the stakeholder will often doubt them.

Take the same scenario but with a master level programmer. This person
speaks with the professional calm of a veteran. Knows how to answer
questions and how to clarify. This breeds trust in to the people they
are speaking to. Their title is similar to why all medical companies
love to put a lab coat on the actors in their commercials, it adds
credibility to their message.

In short, peoples impression of you matter when you want them to listen.
Tech skills don't do much if people won't let you use them.

## What Defines A Mid-level Developer?

The usual expectation people have is that a developer should be
able to unblock themselves and deliver whatever the request is
from the product side of the company. In reality this is very
hard to do since the area you need to understand to do that is
very large and it takes years of effort before you get to a level
where you can master your own workflow. Let alone all the combinations
of tools different companies use in their specific stack.

When you reach the point where you rarely need to ask other developers
for help with common coding problems and you know enough about the
common ways of working to recognize the style of workflow teams usually
use. Then you are a mid-level, at least that is what most of my peers
and me can agree on. Congrats, you are now at the minimum level needed
to be a viable candidate for most of the jobs on the market.

Most companies are looking for mid-level developers or they settle
for them.
It is very hard to find people who are above this level and it
is equally common that people start using the term "senior" when the
skill level they have is roughly the same.

## Why Do Some Developers Never Outgrow The Junior Level?

It surprises many to hear that the difference between a mid-level with
around 5 years of experience, often has the same skill level as a
senior with 20 years. The reason often being that after devs get to
the mid-level range, they know enough to survive and they stick with
a comfortable workflow that they know. It is a bit like strength
training. You work hard to get in to decent shape and then most
stagnate their growth because they find a routine that they like.
Without deliberately trying harder they will stay at about the same
fitness level no matter how many years they spend in the gym.

This is what commonly happens and it is the worst position to be
in when you are a senior.
Junior developers often believe that the biggest problem is that people
will not hire them due to their lack of experience. However, this
is also true for seniors. Seniors have the benefit of a longer CV
but the expectations on their skills are also higher.
The one benefit a junior has when starting a new job is that most
of their coworkers will understand that they are young in their
career and will often overlook poor performance to a greater extent.
This is not the case for more senior profiles, usually. They get judged
much quicker. If they have mostly done basic coding without much
personal growth, they may find that they fail to meet the expectations
put on them.
It is never fun to be in that situation, as a junior or as a senior.
