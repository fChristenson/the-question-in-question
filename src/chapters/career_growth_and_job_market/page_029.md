## Is Getting A Promotion More Satisfying Than Finding A New Job?

Yes, at least for me.

Finding a new job can be easier than getting promoted. Usually it is
because companies view the path to a promotion differently. The idea
is that getting promoted means that you have proven that you are worthy
to ascend the stairs leading to a new echelon of being but when
hiring you just need to have the right experiences on the CV.

The entire problem is best summarized like this. When you want to be
promoted, your manager has a whole history of events to look back on
and reflect over. This will impact their decision a lot. However, when
hiring, there is no such history. In other words, you get evaluated
based on the feelings of your manager and the more history the more
complex their process of deciding. In this regard it is easier to
be get a new job since the decision is made based on your CV and the
impression you gave in your first meeting with a total stranger who
is to become your new boss.

There is one more factor to weigh in. When looking to get promoted,
you may never get anywhere. Not because you aren't good but because
the company has no need for someone higher up the ladder or you are
simply be too good at what you do so they want to keep you where you
are. When hiring you do so because you already need someone. You are
in the market, looking for someone to fill a vacancy. It is a bit like
selling door to door versus being in a store with people shopping.
Knocking on a door is basically trying to sell to a person who may
not even be interested but if they are in the shop, you know that
they are looking.

Thus the idea of job hopping being a better way to climb the ranks
came to be. Well, at least in the gospel that is the loosely coupled
strings of thought I have in my mind.

## Is Growth Limited For Developers Who Prefer Working Alone?

To a point. You may not get any exposure to working in a team
and that is a major part of software development at scale.
However, these experiences may not necessary hold your growth back
if what you want is to do mostly freelancing work.

There is an idea that working in a team is how you grow. I argue
that this is not necessarily true. What matters is what ideas you
are exposed to and what insights you get from experimenting.
If you are lucky, some of those insights will come by working in a
team but that is far from certain. You may be in teams where you learn
nothing from the members no matter how many code reviews you go through.

It is fair to say that you can always gain some exposure to social
interactions in a team and that has value in many areas of life,
but if you don't care about that sort of growth you don't have to
worry. You are perfectly able to grow by yourself and in fact,
more than if you only depend on your peers to teach you.

## How To Evaluate Companies When Applying For A Job?

It depends on what you are looking to evaluate. There are some
general hints that I can share but for the most part you are
going in blind each time. At least, if you want to evaluate how
life working in the company will be. Working conditions can differ
a great deal even within the same role from company to company.

First, I usually look at the role and the tools posted in the description
of the job role. I argue that it is fair to say that, similar tools
mean similar working conditions regardless of company. At least, as
far as the coding is concerned. Your coworkers will differ a lot and
these are people you can't really evaluate before you start working.
Their ideas and values naturally has a large impact on the coding you
will be doing but in general the same stack means roughly the same
type of workflow in each company.

Second, I ask about how the delivery process work. This is important
since depending on the culture you may have to shoulder most work
planning yourself or you may have a whole team of Scrum masters,
various types of product owners and other stakeholders. This gives
me a rough idea of how much process I will be dealing with and how
mature the planning process is.

These are the main points I usually consider.

## How Long Does It Take For A Junior Developer To Be In Demand?

On average, 5 years. However, it is worth knowing that the demand
starts rising even after 1 year of work experience.

5 years is about the time where developers have had a chance to
work long enough to become more or less self reliant. That is the
main thing companies care about. It can be the case that you reach
that point quicker so don't treat 5 years as a hard number but rather
a general estimate.

## How To Choose The Best Opportunities As A Developer?

Start by considering what your long term goals are and how the
options presented to you help you to achieve them. A good mindset
I have followed is to think in terms of hard skills and experiences.
In other words, what do you need to know in order to reach your long
term goals? What opportunities do you have and what skills will they
help you practice? A big part in finding the right career path is
understanding what you need to learn to feel confident when taking
the next step. In some cases you may be tempted to take on work that
is benefitting your employer at the expense of your goals. Try to avoid
these situations and strive to find work that have a mutual benefit
to you and the company. If the company benefits from the work you do
and you gain experience needed for your long term goals, that is the
best possible situation for both parties.

In short, pick opportunities that will grow your market value.
If you you are a junior developer, pick work that will give you
coding practice. If you are a senior, pick up work that will give
you exposure to leadership, if your goal is to climb. What the right
choices are very much depends on your goal but always remember to focus
on skills and experience gained from the work you do. It is those that
give you market value and those people will look first at when you
want to take the next step.

## In Top Companies, Would You Still Understand Tech Under The Hood?

Of course, source code is still source code. Depending on the complexity
of the project, there may be  a lot of code or specific logic that
is hard to grasp but it is not magic. If you speak your native language
do you wonder if you will be understood if you spoke to someone who
is better at it? Sure, they may have to explain some words if they
are outside of your vocabulary but on average you should be able
to hold a conversation.
