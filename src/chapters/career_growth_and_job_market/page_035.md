## How To Spot Areas Of Improvement In A Developer?

First, I suggest you start by asking, is this an area they can improve
in or just a different way from how I want it to be done? I argue that
it is vital that you understand that difference. It is easy to fool
yourself in to thinking that what you believe to be constructive feedback
is being ignored because the person in question isn't good at their
job but in reality it is due to a difference in opinion of how to do
something. It is hard to, but try your best to suggest improvements
on things that you can get a majority consensus on within the team
and steer clear of being too picky about minor things until you
know that people are able to see your point.

Once you know how to present your suggestions to the developer,
look at the delivery process. I argue that the main sign of true
mastership of the craft is end to end understanding of the steps
taken to deliver a system the some under customer.
This means that if you know that the developer lacks knowledge
in some area of the delivery process, it is a perfect thing to
suggest that they improve in. A common case is that developers
know how to write code but lack the knowledge to configure
automated pipelines or deployments. This is a very important
part of the end to end understanding I spoke about, so it makes
sense to make it a priority that the developer at least has a
working understanding of how it works and the confidence to take
on tasks related to it.

My personal trick to figure out the comfort level of developers
in my team, is to create a dynamic where each of the members in
the team is responsible for knowing what I refer to as "shared tasks".
A shared task is i.e a task that more or less anyone in the team
can do with basic training and it is not something that requires
years of training to learn. Examples would be to, facilitate the
daily standup, check logs for errors and of course, configure a
build pipeline so automated tests and similar runs before the code
is deployed.
The dynamics I go for is similar to a teacher in school, who will
ask a random student during class if they can give an example
on a topic related to the subject being taught. This introduces
a way to spot check knowledge for the teacher and with a bit of
no prestige culture, creates an elegant way of reminding the class
to pay attention to at least the main lessons of the subject.

This pattern works for us developers as well. Simply make sure that
the people in the team who are the most confident in shared tasks
don't hog all the work for themselves and be more selective about
who picks up work that is not strictly outside their role in the
team. This puts the developers in a position where they will learn
how to handle a larger part of the end to end delivery.

## What Are The Risks Of Rushing The Onboarding Process For New Developers?

The main risk is that their code won't work or it will cause issues
for other developers. We have to remember that their code is likely
connected to other code and if we want to feel secure in that this
new code will work and that it won't break the current code, we need
to be sure that the new developer knows enough to handle the tasks
given to them.

A good method to help mitigate this risk is to pick tasks for the new
developer that requires less system knowledge to deliver. Some code
changes are core to the entire system and can potentially require very
deep knowledge of the system. This will be a bit much usually to start
with but then there are areas of the code that are more isolated where
adding new code or changing the existing code is less risky and requires
only basic understanding of the area of the code.

This is an ideal place to start a new developer on. It gives them a
chance to learn some part of the system before we throw them in to
the deep end where they will need to understand a large part of the
system before they can change anything.
