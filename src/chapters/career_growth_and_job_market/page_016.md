## What Was Your Best Job Experience As A Software Developer?

That would be when I met Allen and Mark. At the time I was a
junior developer on his second job, I knew nothing and had a
crazy amount of impostor syndrome. That naturally became a
almost bipolar state where I switched between being confident
in that me with my newfound understanding of MicroServices knew
something that they did not and being so crippled with fear of
failure that I had trouble asking for help.

Luckily for me, these where mature, sensible people. Well Mark
was less so than Allen but he got the job done. After a few
months of working together I found that my favorite part of
the workday was to discuss ideas with my coworkers. I still
felt a bit out of my comfort zone because my understanding
of the craft was still not as mature as I would have liked
but we had a lot of fun talks.

I still remember how much of a difference it made to me, just
having someone I could talk to about my own thoughts. To
this day it is the greatest tip I can give to any experienced
developer. Sometimes the most important thing you can do for
someone is to help them sort out their own thoughts by listening
without judging and sharing your experiences while still keeping
the focus on helping their thoughts along.

## How To Pick A Tech Project To Advance Your Career?

I suggest that you ponder what skills you need to meet your
career goals. In the very beginning I usually give the advice
to do projects that teaches you the basics of what it means to
ship an application. Once you know what it means to start with
nothing and getting a working application to the end user, you
know the basics. Next is understanding that there are many types
of applications and ways to ship software. This is when you can
start looking at options, look at what others are using, try things
out to see how it compares to what you already know. There is no such
thing as a perfect stack so just pick what seems to meet your needs.

Once you feel ready to work as a professional you will need to learn
a suite of other tools that are needed to ship software. This is
where it gets a bit tricky. Companies use a range of tools and even
if you have done your homework and studies up on what companies
use in your region, you will find that not all of it is there.
Fret not, most of the time companies are looking for someone who
is close enough for the role they are hiring for.

From this point on you will grow the most by joining a company
and learning what you can. Once you have a few years of experience
you will find that further growth is best done by doing work in
different types of companies. The main thing to keep an eye on is
your own career strategy. It is easy to stay put where it feels safe
and then you will not grow as much so be honest about if you feel
that you have reached your goals or if you need to push more.

It is fine to do coding just for the sake of having an income.
What I suggest you do is to ask if you have long term goals that
may get impacted by your choices today. If you aim to get to the
higher levels of coding roles you will be well served by looking
at how much of the software delivery process you have mastered.
On the other hand, if you aim to go in to management you will
find that being involved in projects where your ideas and ability
to lead to serve you more.

## Whatâ€™s The Best Way To Address Performance Issues In Developers?

I view performance issues as two categories. Low investment and
high investment. I make a habit of looking at the practical skills
each developer has in my team so I can estimate how likely the
person in question will be to raise their ability in whatever
they are lagging behind in. By putting the practical skills
in to these categories I can get a feeling for if the best
approach is to provide training or if I need to escalate
the issue. Whichever approach I go with I make sure to
leave my own frustration at the door. It is important to
remember that no matter how you feel about the performance
of the developer, getting upset about it won't benefit you.

If I find that the core issue is that they lack the needed
experience with a certain concept or process, I am pretty
happy. This is what I would call a low investment since
learning new tools is bread and butter for any software
developer who want's to be relevant. So long as the developer
has the right attitude and is willing to learn we can work
with this.

However, if the core issue is that they struggle to ship code
and I can see that there is no clear pattern to what they find
tricky but rather it seems that whatever they are tasked with
is a struggle, then we in for a tougher choice. I usually
try to allocate simpler and simpler tasks to the developer
before I escalate. This gives us a chance to see if they
perhaps are just matched poorly with the work and would do
better with different type of work.

When the practical skills needed to fix fall in the high
investment category, I need to escalate to resolve the issue.
The reason for this is that when a developer has performance
issues across the board there is no telling if they will ever
reach a higher level of productivity or how long it will take
them to improve enough to meet at least basic expectations.
This means that the manager will need to make a judgement call
about the situation. If the team is fine with having someone
who is not meeting their expectation we can simply continue as
is but if we need to raise their productivity we need to align
on by how much and when it simply is better to look at other
candidates to fill the role.

The most common strategy at this point is to provide the candidate
with the feedback and create a work plan for them with some form
of evaluation deadline. This is not something you can do without
having an effect on morale usually. I suggest you limit the feedback
to the candidate so not to shame them. Simply talk to them in private
and take it from there.
