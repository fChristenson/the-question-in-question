## What Was Your Best Job Experience As A Software Developer?

I would say that it was when I finally felt that I was good enough.

For a long time I, just as many developers, felt like I could not
measure up to the expectations of my coworkers.
I was never fast enough. I would get anxious when people
added comments on my code. I still remember the panic
I felt the first time I broke production.

Over the years the fear started going away but it was only
when I realized that the trust my coworkers and managers
put in me was at a level where my choices had major impact.
Yet I was not afraid. I remember being scared when I had to
fix a bug and now I could comfortably take on work that
had major impact and have people be happy with the results
without breaking a sweat.

The tasks I faced where much larger and the potential
consequences of getting it wrong were massive but I felt
no fear, no anxiety. It was just another project.

## How To Pick A Tech Project To Advance Your Career?

I always recommend that you start by asking where you are in
your career and what goals you have. The choices a junior should
consider can be different than what a senior may want to consider.

For junior developers looking to break in to the industry and
secure a long term career I recommend that you pick projects
that will give you basic training. By basic training I mean
that you get to work with coworkers as part of a team and you
code on a project that will teach you how to ship products
that are built using the same common tools.
For web development the bread and butter project is a CRUD
application with a user interface that people visit through
a web browser.

This choice is significant because once you start working
your previous roles will impact your future prospects.
If you spend a lot of time in niched tools and project
you may find that the interest people show in your CV
is less than for your peers who have skills more relevant
to the industry at large.

I encourage developers to try things out and experiment.
However, you should remember that if your goal is to get
stable work you need to be able to deliver code with the
tools of the trade. So making sure you have those skills
is a good idea if you ask me. At least before your career
progresses for too long.

The reason you want to be a bit tactical with the projects
early on is that as you gain seniority the more expectations
you will in general have on you. In the early days it is more
acceptable that you need support with basic tools and practices
but as you get more years you will in general be expected to
be more self reliant.

For more experienced developers who have the basics down and
have perhaps had a few jobs it matters less what they choose
since their skills are at a level where they can apply for
most jobs and have a good chance of finding work.
These developers will often benefit more from looking at what
they lack to progress. It may be that they want to move in to
a more management type of role and they then need to get exposure
to the sort of environment that puts them in a leader role.
It may be that they want to try a role where they get to work
with different tools and then getting a working understanding
of those tools is a natural choice. It really depends on what
goals they have.

## What Does It Feel Like To Succeed In A Technical Interview?

This is where I say good, right? Yes, it feels good.

I remember when I passed my first interview for a major company.
I was ecstatic and so excited. I think the feeling is as close as
I will get to having my big dream come true.
After years of study and hundreds of hours just trying to figure
out why I wasn't smart enough to figure out why the code would not
work. I had made it through a nerve wracking interview and been
found worthy. How could I not feel good about this epic achievement.

These feeling lasted for about a week and were quickly replaced with
new anxieties and worries. After all now I had to actually make things
for real and now the main concern wasn't to get the job, it was to
keep it.

These days I look back at how I used to view interviews and I still
feel happy when I get an offer. I still feel nervous, although much
less than before. Though much remains somewhat the same I like to
think that I find them less dramatic.

I used to think that passing or failing was the one thing that
determined my value as a programmer. Today I have done enough
interview to feel that they are a lot less a measurement of
my value and more like a talent competition. How well I do
has one part to do with my own skill but a large part is
down to who the judges are so even if one panel of judges
don't like what I do it doesn't mean that another panel
will judge the same way.
