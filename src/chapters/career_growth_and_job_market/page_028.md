## Should You Accept A Job If The Company Uses Cloud Computing?

This is a bit like asking if you should marry someone if they
wear shoes. Well sure, it is a good start to a relationship if
they conform to some basic standards but is it really a deal
breaker if they don't? More importantly, is that really the only
thing you would consider before committing to someone?

Cloud computing is a widespread default for current web development
but it is by no means the only way to run web applications. In
some cases it is either not possible to do it due to a myriad of
reasons or the company is in a state of transitioning to cloud.
We should remember that some companies are older than cloud
services and in fact the internet itself. These company may be
considering to make the switch and due to a range of reasons,
it has simply not happened yet.

I would say that using cloud computing is not the only thing to
consider but there is thought worth considering. Cloud computing
is more or less the norm for modern development today. This is
significant for your market value as a software developer.
Your value is closely related to your knowledge of developing
software with the tools used by the industry. This is a thought
you should always keep with you when choosing where to work.
Ideally you want to work with projects that gives you exposure
to the technology that is most in demand.

## Is Knowing How To Get The Right Support A Key Skill For Senior Developers?

Yes, it is the main difference between juniors and mid level developers
if you ask me. Juniors are viewed as a investment to many companies
due to that they need support and that takes time away from others.
The most common expectation on a more experienced developer, apart
from the speed at which they deliver code, is how capable they are
to work independently. Everyone needs help at times but you will do
well to learn how to best figure out the answer to your own questions.
Each company you work for will have different people and they will
all view giving support in different ways. Some are really helpful
and some are annoyed by it so hope for the best and prepare for
the worst.

## Can A Junior Developer Be Promoted Over A Senior Developer?

In general, no. There is one exception to this rule, at least in
so far as I can see. The exception is if the senior in question is
lacking the social skills to lead the team. In such a situation a
more junior experience may become the tech lead. However, this may
not in itself mean that the junior has more authority. It simply
means that they will be expected to perform tasks the include
leadership and facilitation. Hosting the standup, speaking to
stakeholders and so on. These are tasks that anyone can do, with the
right level of social skills but it is not everyone who is interested
or able to do it well enough to meet the needs of the company.

Promotions in software usually work on a combination of talent for
the craft and years of experience. In other words, it is possible for
a junior to be better than a senior but it can be tough to get promoted
just because of that fact. This is something that, as you can imagine,
does not sit well with a lot of us. Myself included. It is a bias that
I argue, lives on from the value system our species has had for so
long that it is hard to know when it started. The idea I am referring
to is that you are worth something due to some other factor than what
you are able to do for the world. This means more or less than being
part or royalty, being a boss or just someone who is seen as higher
in status, needs to be catered to in order for everyone to get along.
Because of this, your manager can't rightly promote you higher than
someone who is senior, mostly due to that it looks bad and can stir
up trouble. People believe that due to the senior having more years,
they are entitled to some consideration in this area.

I would love to say that you can fight this but I suspect it will be
a lie. Your best hope is to prove your value, get a good relationship
with your manager and be patient. Even if you may find it hard to get
the title "senior" before you have earned enough years, you will still
benefit from being a good developer. Salaries and similar usually have
a range and top performers usually earn a bit more regardless of what
experience level they are placed in.

## Do Principal Engineers Have The Same Coding Skills As Seniors?

Yes, more often than not. The main difference is usually that the senior
is mostly spending their time coding whereas for principal's they
can have a range of tasks. Most of them involve leadership, meetings,
planning and all the fun tasks you can think of that happens outside
of the coding.

In my experience it is usually the case that seniors who become principal's
are placed in that role based on their experience and their social
skills. You can think of the role as the closest thing you can get
to being a manager without having any employees. For a lot of developers
this is as high as you can get while still having the option to code
on a regular basis. It is a bit of a borderland, you can leave the
coding or keep parts of it depending on how the company views the
role but from this point on you will start to drift away from coding
so I urge you to not fall so out of touch that you forget that the
coding is always relevant.

## Have You Worked As A Principal Engineer?

Yes, for several years. The short story is that I started
showing an aptitude for both the technical part of development
and the social part. This combination is what usually is interesting
for managers looking to promote developers to the principal level.

Once I got the role I am happy to say that a lot of the time I spent
learning how to speak in front of people, present my ideas and of course,
the time I invested in learning about all manner of programming languages,
tools and practices, payed of. Big time.

Being a principal engineer is like having one foot in each part of
the development process. If you know your tech and you know how to
connect with people, you will do well. At least if you ask me.

## What Is It Like Working As A Senior Software Developer?

A lot like working as a junior. The main difference is what you need
to be productive and what expectations people will put on you. Most
of the time, you aren't really doing anything other than coding.
However, people in general expect you to be faster and more capable
of tackling tougher tasks. In some cases you are also shouldered with
the blessing, or curse, of being the teams support person. Dealing
with everything from helping juniors, answering questions from the
product owner, being the main contact for all stakeholders and so on.

In short, being a senior is a bit like being a grownup. For the most
part there is not real difference between you and a teenager when
when you work, your are just expected to be more mature.
