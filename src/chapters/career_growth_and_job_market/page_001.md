## What Steps Should Developers Take After Being Laid Off?

I think about job security as being in a survival situation.
Most out-doors enthusiast will tell you that the key to survival
is to be prepared.

In the woods being prepared means things like having shelter
and a water source. In software development it means something different.

Survival tips for software developers are as follows:

- Keep your CV up to date.
- Make sure your CV is easy to find on the web.
- Front the most relevant tools you know on the CV.
- Connect with people on social media.
- Keep up to date with the trends in the trade.
- Practice how to do well in interviews.
- Save enough money to make it through to the next job.

These tips should be practiced before you get laid off.

Once you are out of a job your first move should be to
look at the job postings in your region. I can also
recommend to post a pleasant message on your social
media accounts where you briefly mentions what your
main stack is, how much experience you have and
how to get in touch with you.

## Would You Accept a Position That Down-Levels Your Role?

Personally I would. At this point I have done enough as a software
developer to know how to do decently in any role.

The role is from my point of view just a label that carries
certain responsibilities with it. What matters to me however
is if I enjoy what I do.

Being a principal engineer in a big corporation and then
taking the CTO role in a small startup may seem like a
step up but the practical tasks will often be the same.

Once you learn what you need to hold down most jobs
it really is only you who determines what you would enjoy.
I enjoy engaging work so as long as I am happy with my salary
and my daily routine feels engaging then I don't care what
my title is. The title only really matters when you are trying
to determine who has final say or when you are trying to pad
your CV with things that seem impressive to a new employer.

## Why Do IT Companies Ask If You Were at the Top of Your Class?

When companies hire new developers they leave that task to managers
who don't really know what software development is about.
What they will do is to look at what other companies are doing
for inspiration and they will guess what they believe are signs
of a good developer.

When interviewers ask about your grades, how many side projects
you have and so on. All they want is for you to prove that you
are good at what you do. They want to feel comfortable in that
if they hire you then you will learn fast and be a good fit
for their company.

You can prove this in many ways and even if you didn't make it
to the top of your class you can simply mention that you
made up for it by having side projects or other activities
that prove that you like what you do and that you care about
making good code.

## What Strategies Help Developers Manage Unrealistic Deadlines?

I usually advocate that you ask yourself why you fear a deadline.
Deadlines regardless if they are realistic or unrealistic make
many developers feel nervous so try to understand why you feel
that way.

What I have found is that problems can only be solved by doing
one of two things. Either you simplify the problem or you increase
your capacity for solving the problem.

If your managers sets and unrealistic deadline they fail to understand
this simple truth and more often than not their reason for the
deadline is not that if they fail to meet it something bad will happen
but rather they want to move fast enough to meet some expectation.
This is mean nothing practical for you other than that you will be
part of a missed deadline and if you are ok with that emotionally
you don't need to be bothered by it.

The main tip I can give you is to avoid giving false promises
to your stakeholders and try to be realistic. If your managers
still feels that a sharper deadline is needed let them decide on
it. It really makes no difference other than the emotional impact
it has on the people involved. Keep working and see if you meet
the deadline or not. If you are about to fail you calmly explain
to the manager that you either need to ship less features or
you need more resources. Faster developers could also be an option
but that will likely take a lot longer than simply adding more
people, shipping less code or simply extending the deadline.

I like to think about a software team as a car. If you have
an average car and you think that by just really wanting to
win in a formula one race your going to be able to do it.
Well you are not being realistic I would argue. Winning a
race or shipping good code on time both require you to have
the right people and the right conditions before it is time
to deliver.
