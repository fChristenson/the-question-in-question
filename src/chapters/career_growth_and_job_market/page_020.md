## How To Pass The Trial Period At A New Job?

The trial period is not something that you will face in all companies.
It is a practice employed in different ways in different regions of
the world but the core concept is often the same. The company has some
type of evaluation period when hiring a new developer. During this
period they will look at how well the developer fits in the company.
There may be legal aspects to consider for them as well depending on
the labour laws so this period can be extra important.

The suggestions I usually make are:

- Smile
- Increase positive communication by 40%
- Be an active learner
- Learn your environment before you change it

These tips will get you most of the way through. It goes without saying
I hope that having the skills needed to meet expectations is vital
but I argue that it isn't really productive to suggest what can't be
actively worked on. You can after all not magically become better than
you are without practice and practice is something you should already
be doing or you should at least be confident in that you have the skills.

Let's elaborate a bit on this list of mine. First, smiling is a given
I hope. During this period your social skills will factor in just as
your tech skills so a good impression will help you. Second, learn
how to communicate in a positive manner and how to give suggestions
on improvements without sounding too critical. It may feel better
to be able to vent frustration in a satisfying way but you may end
up sending the wrong message. Third, make sure you don't just sit
and wait for others to give you an onboarding. You are better off
showing that you are there to get up to speed. Ask relevant questions
so you can get your work environment up. Make sure you note important
practices and documents. Lastly, make sure you take the time to
understand how your coworkers view their environment. Even if you may
have the best suggestions and love the craft more than anyone, they
may feel differently. Even if you know that things could be better,
remember that you may be working with people who care less than you.
If that is the case and you start pointing out all the flaws you see
without being careful, you may start pissing people off.
Even if you are right it will not matter if the people you work with
don't care about improving. This is a tough pill to swallow for some
but the best way I can describe it is by an example.

Imagine that you want to play football and then you join a local
team of amateurs. Now lets say you feel that your team should be
aiming to play as best as you can and you start pushing the others
to practice more. After a while the rest of the team stop showing
up or you may even get frozen out. So what could be happening?
Well, if they want to just play around casually and have a good time
it will get pretty annoying to have someone who is always nagging them
about working harder. In such a situation the best course of action
is for you to ask if this is the team for you or if you should adapt?

## Is It Okay To Take A Break From Studying Software Development?

I hope this goes without saying but, yes. The main thing is to be
honest about how much effort you are putting in. It can be easy to
make mental investments that are simply too low for you to make
any meaningful progress. I have been learning Spanish for longer
than I care to admit and I can still only speak enough to hold
the simplest of conversations. This is mainly due to that my
investment has been around 15 minutes per day. Clearly, that
is not enough for me to master the language to the level I want.

The same is true for your journey in software development. If
you treat it as a serious effort with a time investment that is
similar to a full time job or going to college, you will see
results. However, if you on and off with the practice you may
never get good enough to do it professionally. That may not be
your goal so just set your expectations correctly.

## Is It A Red Flag If A Candidate Lacks Specific Experiences?

It depends on the experiences. There are certainly experiences
that are one off in your career and that most of us have never
had to dealt with. However, there are also experiences that almost
all developer have in some way or another had. If a candidate lacks
those we may find it hard to relate to each other and that is often
where red flags are raised. The interviewer will most of the time
draw upon their own ideas of what an experienced software developer
should know and what they should have done so if they lack experience
in these areas of evaluation, they may not get the job.
This of course the most lamented part of the interview by all developers.
Why are they evaluating me on these things?! These are not things that
matter. They should be doing things differently!
I can only sigh and agree in some cases but just as with any evaluation,
be it at test in school, a talent show or a job interview, the judge
dictates what a passing grade is.
