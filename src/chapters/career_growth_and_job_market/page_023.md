## What Are The Best Practices For Conducting Technical Interviews?

If you ask me, a personal interview and some basic code test.
I am not a fan of big coding challenges and lord knows I have had
some truly bizarre tests that took several days to complete. Frankly
speaking, I believe that the reason for these sorts of test is due
to how laughably ignorant managers in IT companies are of the craft
and the skills needed to excel at it.

My base argument is this. The code test has merit due to that if you
don't have one you will need to allocate time to every single candidate
that applies. That is perhaps not a practical use of your time since
some of them will not have even basic skills. So what to do?
I suggest you create a basic test that reflects your tech stack so
that you can get some sense of if the candidates are able to develop
a junior level application with the tools you need them to use.
This means that you can screen for people who at least have the basic
skills needed and save some time.

Once you know that it is worth having an interview with the person,
it is time to ponder if you have the skills needed to do an effective
interview. I argue that this is where the bulk of information about
the candidates seniority is found but in order to know what questions
to ask, you need to know the trade. For a fellow developer it is easy
to hear if someone has used the tools they use and at about what level
they are in their career right now.

## What Questions Reveal True Expertise In An Interview?

My argument is that one of the ways people relate to each other is
through shared experiences. In other words, a senior developer will
have gone through similar challenges in some areas that other seniors
have. Here is the tricky part, how do we know what experiences to look
for? This is the main reason I argue that hiring developers should
be done by other developers. It is relatively easy to come up with
some technical questions and figure out if the candidate understands
them but requires experience to figure out what the daily challenges
is for a software developer and how to create questions that prompts
the candidate to respond in a meaningful way.

As my little prelude on this question indicates, I believe that the
most effective way to determine expertise in an interview is by
asking questions related to experience. The main goal is to assert
that the candidate has had hands on experience dealing with many of
the daily tasks a developer faces. I try as much as possible to avoid
asking questions about broad topics such as how their career has looked
or what their values are when I am trying to figure out their seniority
level. These questions can suck up a lot of time in the interview and
a skilled candidate can easily answer such questions without ever really
going in to any details. I much prefer to ask very specific questions
that can be answered regardless of skill level.
If I ask a candidate, "have you worked with any ORM's and why do we
use them?", I know that the answer will need to be specific and it
will help me understand to what level the candidate has worked with
ORM's, in this case. The same approach can be applied to any tool
and my favorite part is to follow up by asking things such as,
"do you see any benefits or issues with using one tool over another?".
This puts the candidate in a spot where they quickly show how much
reflecting they have done on their work and the tools they use.
It is this experience that helps me figure out how they think about
technology and to what extent their decisions are based on experience.
Understanding a candidates way of thinking is a really great way to
get a sneak peak at what type of coworker they will be.

## What About Being A Junior Developer Who Can't Measure Up?

There is reason to sugarcoat it, it sucks.
I have sadly been here as many others. I did not care for it.
However, there is little you can do in the moment. You need
time to develop your skills and that takes however long it
takes. What I like to suggest to developer who go through this
is to find a decent coping mechanism. We all get affected by
troublesome times differently but we all in one way or another
find things that make the journey bearable.

In addition to having things in your life to help you get through
tough work conditions, I can recommend to view all experience as
a net good. The old saying, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger",
comes to mind. It may be little comfort in the moment but I urge you
to use the experiences you are getting, reflect on them and derive
what is useful from them so you at least gain something from the whole
ordeal.

## Are The First Years Of A Developerâ€™s Career The Most Transformative?

I would say so. I argue that the main reason for the average company
wanting at least 5 years work experience from a candidate is precisely
because that is roughly the time they need to become an asset.
You and I know that this idea is not entirely as clear cut as that
but it is never the less something managers practice and there is at
least a grain of truth in it.

When you start your career as a software developer, you know next to
nothing. It is natural that you will feel a bit out of your depth
and early on you will learn a lot about the basics. However, I argue
that there are a few transformation worth being aware of that gives
a bit if nuance. First of all, going from never having a job as a
software developer to someone having one is of course a transformation.
This is the main one that companies hiring developers are aware of
and it is common to believe that it happens after around 5 years.
I argue however, that there are at least 2 more that will happen.

The second transformation happens when you learn that coding is
one part of your job and the other is people. You learn that there
is a bunch of people who you need to align with in order to even
write any code. You have stakeholders, teammates, project owners
and tons of meetings before you get to do any work on the code.
After a while you start to learn how important that part is for
the end result. If this part works poorly you quickly find that
your system goes to shit and nobody likes their work anymore.

The third transformation only happens once you reach true
seniority if you ask me. This is when you learn that code
is about business value and that the goal is to make the
choices needed to delivery the right type of system.
This means that you now know what Agile work practices
are good to use, what tech stack to pick and how to talk
to the people who are involved in the project so everything
goes smoothly. This is when you start looking at your code
as something that is just there to deliver on some goal and
it is no longer a goal in of itself.
