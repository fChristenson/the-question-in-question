## How can teams provide constructive feedback?

As a rule I try to pose things like a suggestion. I put on my
"Donkey" persona and much like a waiter discussing menu choices
with a customer, I propose what I believe would be a good option.
It is very important that we have feedback conversations from a
constructive point. All too often I find that people have a lot
of complaints but seem to lack any suggestion on how to fix the
issue at hand. This is in my experience rarely a good way to
get anything done. Usually it ends with someone getting fired
or nothing happening at all.

There is a exercise I use to know when it is time for me to take
action on something that isn't working so well with how my coworker
does their job. I start by asking myself if there is anything
specific that will have a negative impact on project quality or
the teams ability to meet goals on time. If there is not, then
I have to ask why I feel bothered by what is going on. In these
cases I usually find that having a honest conversation with someone
I trust is a good starting point and I may raise my feelings on the
subject with either the person in question, given we have a good
relationship, or confide in my manager.

If I find that there are specific things that does have an impact
on the project I favour speaking to the team as a unit rather than
directing the feedback to a specific person. By simply suggesting
what I believe to be a good practice to follow and making the
conversation about the team jointly deciding to follow it, I can
make sure that the feedback reaches the right person and it has
the added benefit of being something the team as a whole enforces
rather than just me. As a rule, I find that people find getting
feedback easier to digest in a group than as an individual and I
account for that when I give it.

If the issue is related to performance or something similarly
intangible where the option of asking the team to commit to a joint
way of working isn't an option, things get messier. In cases like these
I do as I always do, try to be concrete about the feedback and then
I speak to the manager. I provide my honest opinion and my suggestions
in the best way I can and then I ask the manager to understand that
this feedback is of course just from my point of view. I also make
sure that we check if my viewpoint is shared with others in the team
so we can make the fairest assessment possible. It is after all
important that as the provider of the feedback, I give myself a
reality check so I don't trick myself into believing that what
I believe to be true is what everyone believes.

## Do You Try to Fully Understand Pull Requests During Reviews?

Yes, I would be worried if anyone did something besides that.
However, I have to admit that I love comfort and have been known
to be too lazy to properly read whatever I am looking at, even
when I really should. I never bought in to the practice of
keeping pull requests small for the sake of the reader, I always
favoured having them be a unit of meaning so I can understand how
this code fits in the goal we want to achieve. But, that doesn't
help much when I have low blood sugar and just want to do anything
other than read several files of unit test cases so although I do
think the reviewer should know what the feature specification is
before reading, I would be a liar if I said that I have never skipped
that part and just glanced before hitting the approve button.

The practice I favour is to include a link to the feature specification
in the description of the pull request. By doing so I know that
the reviewer can easily check what the pull request is for and
it also gives me an easy way to check on any scope updates or just
an easy way to double check that I did in fact make the code do
whatever the specification is about.

More often then not do I see that code reviews are just a glance
by the reviewer and then a quick click on the approve button.
This is probably the biggest tell of a quality developer and I
keep an eye out for review comments that are meaningful and shows
that the developer understand the difference between what the code
is currently doing and what the feature wants the code to do.
The best developers understand that if all you have checked is
what the pull request has changed and you don't know what the feature
is supposed to be about, then you have no idea if the code is actually
doing the right thing or not. This is more important than if the
perfect variable name was used or if someone used the right style of
syntax.

## What Traits Do the Best Software Developers Have?

Most of them have almost a sixth sense for figuring out
good solutions to technical problems. Apart from this gift,
I find that they show genuine interest in their craft and
constantly try out different methods of working. Though
it is worth mentioning that very few of them show the same
level of enthusiasm for everything related to development.
As is common with many fields, some parts seem interesting
and some less so, depending on the person.

The most telling sign for me to tell when I am speaking to
a great software developer is the way they express their
thoughts. Usually I can hear to what depth they have pondered
a topic, what they have considered and what they are unsure about.
When they speak I can see fire in their eyes and when they work
I they put actual love in to their work, not because someone is
making them but because they want to.

## Are You a Senior Developer When Problems No Longer Scare You?

No, I would argue not. How intimidated you are by something is
certainly a sign, to some extent, of your confidence level but
that is not what makes you senior. At least not in my view.

The main factor that determines seniority I would argue, is how
much experience you have with a given subject. Experience is what
you gain from practicing, facing issues and overcoming them and
the insights this process gives you. You can be shaking like a
leaf the whole way through but if you are able to draw upon the
experience you have to produce decent results, then the issue
is not your experience but confidence.

I know it seems strange to some but let us remember that even
professional models feel unattractive at times, even though
most reasonable people would say otherwise.

## Whatâ€™s the best way to address performance issues in developers?

I view performance issues as two categories. Low investment and
high investment. I make a habit of looking at the practical skills
each developer has in my team so I can estimate how likely the
person in question will be to raise their ability in whatever
they are lagging behind in. By putting the practical skills
in to these categories I can get a feeling for if the best
approach is to provide training or if I need to escalate
the issue. Whichever approach I go with I make sure to
leave my own frustration at the door. It is important to
remember that no matter how you feel about the performance
of the developer, getting upset about it won't benefit you.

If I find that the core issue is that they lack the needed
experience with a certain concept or process, I am pretty
happy. This is what I would call a low investment since
learning new tools is bread and butter for any software
developer who want's to be relevant. So long as the developer
has the right attitude and is willing to learn we can work
with this.

However, if the core issue is that they struggle to ship code
and I can see that there is no clear pattern to what they find
tricky but rather it seems that whatever they are tasked with
is a struggle, then we in for a tougher choice. I usually
try to allocate simpler and simpler tasks to the developer
before I escalate. This gives us a chance to see if they
perhaps are just matched poorly with the work and would do
better with different type of work.

When the practical skills needed to fix fall in the high
investment category, I need to escalate to resolve the issue.
The reason for this is that when a developer has performance
issues across the board there is no telling if they will ever
reach a higher level of productivity or how long it will take
them to improve enough to meet at least basic expectations.
This means that the manager will need to make a judgement call
about the situation. If the team is fine with having someone
who is not meeting their expectation we can simply continue as
is but if we need to raise their productivity we need to align
on by how much and when it simply is better to look at other
candidates to fill the role.

The most common strategy at this point is to provide the candidate
with the feedback and create a work plan for them with some form
of evaluation deadline. This is not something you can do without
having an effect on morale usually. I suggest you limit the feedback
to the candidate so not to shame them. Simply talk to them in private
and take it from there.

## How to Deal with Engineers Seeking Promotions Too Soon?

I would say that you should ask, why do you feel it is too soon?

I argue that promotion should be based on the needs of the company
and if the developer has the needed profile to fill the role.
This is how hiring works but for some reason many seem to view
promotion different from hiring. There is this idea that you should
have proof that you have done the job you are asking to get promoted
to, which is utter nonsense if you ask me. If you hire someone to do
a job then you can expect them to do that job but if you expect them
to prove to you that they can do another job before you promote them,
you will need to be lucky enough to have a job that allows that to
happen. If you are never provided the opportunity to do work that is
relevant for the role you want, then you will never be able to progress.

When evaluating someone for a promotion, simply ask if there is enough
to go on in order to feel confident in that this person can handle
the work. If there is not, provide the developer with a set of activities
that will give them a chance to prove their abilities. This is a reasonable
thing to ask, I would argue and it will show if the request for promotion
is too early or not.

## What Does It Feel Like to Succeed in a Technical Interview?

Pretty good, I must say. It took me a few years to understand
something that changed my way of looking at interviews but even
today it feels nice to succeed.

The main thing that changed my way of looking at interviews was
that I noticed how subjective the hiring process is and even what
many consider to be good code. I had lengthy arguments with people
about what the correct way of doing something was in one company
and in another the answer was considered so obvious that we never
discussed it. When I understood that getting accepted is one part
knowing your tools but also one part the values of the person doing
the interview, my viewpoint changed. I started to look at interviews
as something closer to a talent show than some objective assessment
of my skills as a software developer. Who wins a talent show is to
some extent based on their talent but also what the judges and producers
think.

When I let myself feel a bit more confident in my abilities, mainly
due to that I know for a fact that I have shipped hundreds of features
some who have even worked, I started to take interviews a bit less
seriously. The feeling was similar to how I felt when I stopped thinking
that getting a comment on my code in a pull request was a personal
attack on me. At some point you understand that it is nearly impossible
to always win and the main thing to consider is if you do well on average.
When you know that most of the time you do well enough the impact of
the outcomes affect you less. At least for me.

## Why Do Development Teams Love Agile?

I would not go as far as to say all of us love it.
To my mind it is a topic of debate and will probably never be
a settled matter. Agile, just as any other process has it's time
in the spotlight and I am sure that whatever comes after will be
just as debated as Agile is today.

The key elements that makes any project successful has, in my
view, very little to do with a work framework and more to do
with an equal part of good team rituals and good teamwork.
These concepts are not unique to Agile and most development
teams usually find a way to do work regardless of what work
framework they use. Since the topic of Agile vs other approaches
is still under debate, I feel it is safe to say that Agile so
far has not been proven to provide any definitive benefit that
you can't get by other means.

I see more teams go through the motions of Agile than I see
truly effective processes and in my view, that is due to the
inherit problem with a mental framework someone else made up
for you. Copy pasting a solution someone else has shown you
is in my view less effective than taking the time to understand
how you can make sure that the practical matters you need in place
during your work are there when they need to be. I suggest that
what development teams love is not Agile but rather rituals and
team norms that make sense to them. So far no one I have worked
with feels that all things Agile is a good idea and so I simply
suggest that you pick what works and leave the rest.

I can't really speak for others but I suspect the positive feedback
people get is similar to how people struggling with being overweight.
When people who mean well, see someone taking a risk to improve their
life, the natural response for many is to praise them. After all they
are taking charge of their life and going out fixing something.
The praise is intended to make you feel good, not think rationally.
There is no harm done here since we should in my view separate the
two. You can praise someone for doing something to improve and you
can tell them if what they are trying is realistic without one
harming the other. It is a fine balance naturally, since some people
would prefer to feel good rather than be realistic. Though it is
worth knowing that pessimistic views can often be disguised as
realistic thinking.

Ageism is not something exclusive to IT. It is also not much
different from other prejudices various groups face in the market.
I find that the real determining factor for if a candidates age has
any meaningful impact is not the number of years they have lived but
rather what type of person they have become during those years.
I have seen people of a distinguished age get work in everything
that the fresh graduates get. I can't recall any interview I have been
to where the topic of the candidates age came in to question.

As you can imagine, my experiences are by no means an absolute truth
when we discuss the subject of ageism. I am certain that there are
people who wrinkle their noses in disgust at CV's where the candidate
has one too many wrinkles on their face. I like to imagine that as
they do they carefully check that there is no bald spot emerging nor
any crowfeet peaking out from under their makeup.

If you are subjected to these sorts of people my best advice is to
do what we all do. Try again with another company. If you have the
skills and you have a lovable personality with a spare smile for
the people you greet in the interview, most rational people will
seriously consider you for the position.

## What Was Your Best Job Experience as a Software Developer?

That would be when I met Allen and Mark. At the time I was a
junior developer on his second job, I knew nothing and had a
crazy amount of impostor syndrome. That naturally became a
almost bipolar state where I switched between being confident
in that me with my newfound understanding of MicroServices knew
something that they did not and being so crippled with fear of
failure that I had trouble asking for help.

Luckily for me, these where mature, sensible people. Well Mark
was less so than Allen but he got the job done. After a few
months of working together I found that my favorite part of
the workday was to discuss ideas with my coworkers. I still
felt a bit out of my comfort zone because my understanding
of the craft was still not as mature as I would have liked
but we had a lot of fun talks.

I still remember how much of a difference it made to me, just
having someone I could talk to about my own thoughts. To
this day it is the greatest tip I can give to any experienced
developer. Sometimes the most important thing you can do for
someone is to help them sort out their own thoughts by listening
without judging and sharing your experiences while still keeping
the focus on helping their thoughts along.

## How to Pick a Tech Project to Advance Your Career?

I suggest that you ponder what skills you need to meet your
career goals. In the very beginning I usually give the advice
to do projects that teaches you the basics of what it means to
ship an application. Once you know what it means to start with
nothing and getting a working application to the end user, you
know the basics. Next is understanding that there are many types
of applications and ways to ship software. This is when you can
start looking at options, look at what others are using, try things
out to see how it compares to what you already know. There is no such
thing as a perfect stack so just pick what seems to meet your needs.

Once you feel ready to work as a professional you will need to learn
a suite of other tools that are needed to ship software. This is
where it gets a bit tricky. Companies use a range of tools and even
if you have done your homework and studies up on what companies
use in your region, you will find that not all of it is there.
Fret not, most of the time companies are looking for someone who
is close enough for the role they are hiring for.

From this point on you will grow the most by joining a company
and learning what you can. Once you have a few years of experience
you will find that further growth is best done by doing work in
different types of companies. The main thing to keep an eye on is
your own career strategy. It is easy to stay put where it feels safe
and then you will not grow as much so be honest about if you feel
that you have reached your goals or if you need to push more.

It is fine to do coding just for the sake of having an income.
What I suggest you do is to ask if you have long term goals that
may get impacted by your choices today. If you aim to get to the
higher levels of coding roles you will be well served by looking
at how much of the software delivery process you have mastered.
On the other hand, if you aim to go in to management you will
find that being involved in projects where your ideas and ability
to lead to serve you more.
