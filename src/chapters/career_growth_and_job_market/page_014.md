## How Can Teams Provide Constructive Feedback?

As a rule I try to pose things like a suggestion. I put on my
"Donkey" persona and much like a waiter discussing menu choices
with a customer, I propose what I believe would be a good option.
It is very important that we have feedback conversations from a
constructive point. All too often I find that people have a lot
of complaints but seem to lack any suggestion on how to fix the
issue at hand. This is in my experience rarely a good way to
get anything done. Usually it ends with someone getting fired
or nothing happening at all.

There is a exercise I use to know when it is time for me to take
action on something that isn't working so well with how my coworker
does their job. I start by asking myself if there is anything
specific that will have a negative impact on project quality or
the teams ability to meet goals on time. If there is not, then
I have to ask why I feel bothered by what is going on. In these
cases I usually find that having a honest conversation with someone
I trust is a good starting point and I may raise my feelings on the
subject with either the person in question, given we have a good
relationship, or confide in my manager.

If I find that there are specific things that does have an impact
on the project I favour speaking to the team as a unit rather than
directing the feedback to a specific person. By simply suggesting
what I believe to be a good practice to follow and making the
conversation about the team jointly deciding to follow it, I can
make sure that the feedback reaches the right person and it has
the added benefit of being something the team as a whole enforces
rather than just me. As a rule, I find that people find getting
feedback easier to digest in a group than as an individual and I
account for that when I give it.

If the issue is related to performance or something similarly
intangible where the option of asking the team to commit to a joint
way of working isn't an option, things get messier. In cases like these
I do as I always do, try to be concrete about the feedback and then
I speak to the manager. I provide my honest opinion and my suggestions
in the best way I can and then I ask the manager to understand that
this feedback is of course just from my point of view. I also make
sure that we check if my viewpoint is shared with others in the team
so we can make the fairest assessment possible. It is after all
important that as the provider of the feedback, I give myself a
reality check so I don't trick myself into believing that what
I believe to be true is what everyone believes.

## Do You Try To Fully Understand Pull Requests During Reviews?

Yes, I would be worried if anyone did something besides that.
However, I have to admit that I love comfort and have been known
to be too lazy to properly read whatever I am looking at, even
when I really should. I never bought in to the practice of
keeping pull requests small for the sake of the reader, I always
favoured having them be a unit of meaning so I can understand how
this code fits in the goal we want to achieve. But, that doesn't
help much when I have low blood sugar and just want to do anything
other than read several files of unit test cases so although I do
think the reviewer should know what the feature specification is
before reading, I would be a liar if I said that I have never skipped
that part and just glanced before hitting the approve button.

The practice I favour is to include a link to the feature specification
in the description of the pull request. By doing so I know that
the reviewer can easily check what the pull request is for and
it also gives me an easy way to check on any scope updates or just
an easy way to double check that I did in fact make the code do
whatever the specification is about.

More often then not do I see that code reviews are just a glance
by the reviewer and then a quick click on the approve button.
This is probably the biggest tell of a quality developer and I
keep an eye out for review comments that are meaningful and shows
that the developer understand the difference between what the code
is currently doing and what the feature wants the code to do.
The best developers understand that if all you have checked is
what the pull request has changed and you don't know what the feature
is supposed to be about, then you have no idea if the code is actually
doing the right thing or not. This is more important than if the
perfect variable name was used or if someone used the right style of
syntax.

## What Traits Do The Best Software Developers Have?

Most of them have almost a sixth sense for figuring out
good solutions to technical problems. Apart from this gift,
I find that they show genuine interest in their craft and
constantly try out different methods of working. Though
it is worth mentioning that very few of them show the same
level of enthusiasm for everything related to development.
As is common with many fields, some parts seem interesting
and some less so, depending on the person.

The most telling sign for me to tell when I am speaking to
a great software developer is the way they express their
thoughts. Usually I can hear to what depth they have pondered
a topic, what they have considered and what they are unsure about.
When they speak I can see fire in their eyes and when they work
I they put actual love in to their work, not because someone is
making them but because they want to.

## Are You A Senior Developer When Problems No Longer Scare You?

No, I would argue not. How intimidated you are by something is
certainly a sign, to some extent, of your confidence level but
that is not what makes you senior. At least not in my view.

The main factor that determines seniority I would argue, is how
much experience you have with a given subject. Experience is what
you gain from practicing, facing issues and overcoming them and
the insights this process gives you. You can be shaking like a
leaf the whole way through but if you are able to draw upon the
experience you have to produce decent results, then the issue
is not your experience but confidence.

I know it seems strange to some but let us remember that even
professional models feel unattractive at times, even though
most reasonable people would say otherwise.
