## Should New Developers Choose Languages With Large Communities?

Yes, almost always.

The goal of coding professionally is to create a system that provides
some form of business value to your customer. This seems simple when
you hear it but often you will find that development teams seem to
forget this basic truth. They start bringing in tools and libraries
that can have questionable value and they do so most often because
of their own ideals.

If we go up a level from how a common software developer usually
thinks about the coding they do. As mentioned, the norm is that
they look at their work from their own perspective and that is a
perspective that usually focuses on their own preferences.
However, if try to look at development work from the eyes of the
company managers. Their ideal state would be that the development
is fast, the system works and it is easy to hire new people for
the project.

From a business perspective, these are factors that are more important
than the engineering details you and I may be focusing on as software
developers.

From this insight we can derive that when we are creating development
teams, the average company will favour to have projects that give them
an easy time to hire people and get them productive. This is naturally
not always how things play out but it is the most common desire.

This means that when we pick tech for development our goal should be
to pick tools that have a wide adoption. This means that we can find
people who know them and there is a large pool of knowledge that can
be tapped for the developers doing the work.

I have a directive that I give the teams I work with. "I care more
about how productive a junior developer is than how happy a senior
is with the tools we use.". The reasoning I use is that seniors are
at a level where using the boring mainstream tools will perhaps not
be the most exciting choice in the world for them, but they will be
able to meet the goals of the company. However, if we have a complicated
setup or a niched language choice, we may not be able to bring in
any juniors and we may even find it hard to get seniors who feel
comfortable with our stack.

I argue that on average picking a language with a large community is
a good choice, both for teams and for junior developers who are getting
in to the industry. The popularity of the language usually means that
you have a lot of peers that can share their knowledge and the market
usually has a decent supply of developers to pick from.

Languages who are less established or have smaller communities are
not a bad choice in any way, we just need to consider what choices
we are making and who benefits when we pick our tools. Especially
when our choices has an impact on the future of our projects and
perhaps our career.

## How Can Developers Demonstrate Their Value To Stakeholders?

The main way you become an asset to your stakeholders is by doing
the following 2 things.

First, speak with the voice of experience. Most of your stakeholders
don't know anything about your work or how programming works. This
means that they more or less have to trust what you tell them and
if you give them reason to doubt your expertise it will give them
an uneasy feeling.

Think about it a bit as if you go to the doctor or when you sit in
a plane. You don't really know anything about how medicine or planes
work but you feel calm if the people in charge are calm, collected
and seem to know what they are doing. You would probably be a bit
uneasy if they had bad communication skills, seemed like they
didn't really know their job or simply couldn't answer your questions.

Getting a experienced voice comes with years of work but it can help
to make sure that you can communicate effectively with your stakeholders.
Remember that they don't really know anything about your job so if
you can explain things to them so the feel that they understand to
some small extent, they will love working with you and they will
trust you. Trust is one of the most important things you can earn.
It is what allows you to pick your tools and what determines if you
get to refactor or not.

Second, connect mentally with your stakeholders. In other words we
commonly refer to this as having a business mindset.

This sounds fancy but the basic meaning is that you understand why
your are building the system, for who and what they are trying to
gain from the features they want.

If you are able to understand the stakeholders and come with suggestions
of how things can be done, present alternatives for work that can
be costly or explain the impact of their choices, they will love you
for it. Remember, they don't know your craft, they just want a good
system and if you can help guide them to that goal they will want
you to weigh in on almost all features they want.

To summarize, make your stakeholders feel like you know your craft.
Make them feel like you are listening to their needs and understand
them.


## What Best Practices Ensure Effective Onboarding For New Developers?

Start by making a simple onboarding step by step guide. It should just
be a simple checklist with links and instructions of how to get the
new developer up and running with a local setup of the system. Add
visual aids when needed but keep the content focused on helping them
get their development environment working so they can start writing
code.

Avoid creating excessive system diagrams and overviews. Favour instead
having a session with the developer where the team goes through the
systems main features, what the infrastructure looks like and what
supporting systems you use to monitor and deliver to production.

Finally, create one or two small work tasks for the developer that
lets them commit some minor code changes and deliver that code to
a production environment, end to end. This will help them understand
how the workflow looks without needing to take on a big task early.

For good measure, make sure that you have documentation of important
contacts outside of the team and common tasks that may need to be done
on a semi regular basis.
