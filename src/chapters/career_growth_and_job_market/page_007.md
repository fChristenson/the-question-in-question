## How Do Career Ladders In IT Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.

## How Should Developers Handle Disagreements With Managers?

I have always favoured what I call the expert democracy.
The core of my argument is that any difference of opinion
needs to start with some shared values about what makes someone
correct or incorrect on a subject. If both sides can agree that
there are factors that can determine if someones argument is more
valid than another, progress can be made. If neither side can
agree on what determines if someone is correct no progress can
be made.

As software developers we have some common values that naturally
come up in most decisions we make. Time is a big one, if something
will help us save time we often agree that it has value. Quality
is another one, we most of the time agree that quality matters
to some point. These values are what we need to agree on matters
in order for us to argue for or against something in a practical
way.

If your manager feels differently from you about a subject your
best move most of the time is to argue from a value perspective.
Present what your thoughts are and try to position your argument
from the values you share with your manager. Time and quality are
often simple areas to argue from since they are easy to comprehend
for people regardless of their technical understanding.

However, there is a key element that you need to understand and
that is perhaps the most underestimated truth of engineering.
Any successful marketing enthusiast or sales representative will
likely vouch for that before you can discuss where to put your
time and money you need the people in charge to be open to
try what your are proposing. If they don't agree with you it does
not matter how amazing your ideas are, they will never happen
as long as the people your are talking to are blocking your effort.

For us software developers the same obstacle will be in play. If
your manager wants to do something other than you, persuasion is
your most viable option. If you can't persuade them you will need
to pick your fights and move on. It is sadly not uncommon for people
with amazing ideas to be shut down by people who simply don't agree
and are not persuaded by the arguments presented.
This is why you should never underestimate the value of strong
social skills, a good reputation and above all, knowing how to win
peoples trust. These are tools just as valuable as the tools you
use to write code because without them you may never get to write
the code in the way you want or use the tools of your choice.

## How Should Developers Navigate Decision Making In Tech Teams?

I would say this is the most underestimated skill of the job.
Most choices have multiple ways paths forward. So how do you
make the rights ones and perhaps just as importantly, how
do you make others see your point of view.

My best tip is to consider how a democracy works. If you
all agree that there is a range of choices to be made then
your next step is to evaluate what choices holds the most
promise. If you are lucky you are left with one choice that
you all agree one. If you are not so fortunate you will need
to pick. This is where a simple vote usually is the best way.

The trick to getting the democratic approach to work in tech
is to reduce the cost of failure as much as is possible.
Most people who feel strongly about something usually view
things from the perspective of how things will look in a best
or worst case. However it is rare that their idea of what will
be or not be is as clean cut as they make it up to be.
We software developers know that it is nearly impossible to
predict exactly how long something takes or how well a solution
will work given enough time. That is why we try to reduce the scope
of what we deliver since we know that the less that is in scope
the easier it is for us to estimate and measure.

I argue that you should approach your own technical decisions
the same way. Agree to disagree on a choice, vote on it and then
allow whoever wins the vote to prove their idea with a small
experiment. This gives the opposing side a chance to evaluate
the choice without blocking any progress and it gives the side
advocating the choice a chance to prove that their idea will work.

This approach removes much of the fear of making a poor choice
and it allows you to try out a choice and see if it works. If
the benefits you expect are shown in the experiment you can feel
confident in expanding the scope of the idea. However, if they
are not there you can evaluate the options again and this time
your viewpoints may be different from the first time.

## What Would You Say to a CEO Who Belittles Your Work?

Not much. I have been on the opposing side of enough people
to feel comfortable being doubted. I expect to be treated with
the respect anyone is due regardless of who I speak to but further
than that I don't push my expectations on other people.

Given that the CEO in question has some ideas on what my work
is lacking, I am more than happy to hear them. I have made a
note of never becoming too sure of that I am correct about what
I believe. The method I have used for years is to simply keep
all code I ever wrote since my school days so that when I get
too full of myself I can go back and see the quality of work
I used to do. The experience is unpleasant and cringe worthy
but it does help for me.

Once I have an idea of what the issue the CEO has is with my
work I ask myself the only question I ever really ponder when
questions of performance become a topic of review.
The question is "given our current situation, are these results
within reasonable expectations?".
The power of this question is best described with an example I
like to use. If you hire a company of movers to move your
belongings, there are reasonable expectations to consider.
Odds or that a group of average people will show up to your
door and do the work. If you expect them to be bodybuilders
your expectations are probably not realistic. However, if a group
of frail people who can barely move anything appears, it is
reasonable to expect more from people who move things professionally.

If the CEO expects high results and they don't have an understanding
of what is realistic, why would I care about their viewpoint. At
best it is a viewpoint of someone who doesn't have realistic
expectations and so arguing with them is pointless. I simply
try my best to explain why the results look as they do.
I find that this usually is enough for a rationally minded person
and then we make a action plan to improve the situation.
However, if the CEO is not a reasonable person and is simply
out to vent frustration I ask myself if I am overall happy with
how my place of work treats me. If I am, I treat the CEO as any
person I don't get along with but want to have a professional
relationship with. Otherwise I look at my options and move on.

## How to Deal with Impostor Syndrome in Software Development?

Probably the most common insecurity of any developer is the feeling
of not being as good as you need to be.
To this day I am not completely rid of the feeling of anxiety
that comes from not being able to meet expectations.
It has changed from being about my level of coding to being more
about my ability to interact without stakeholders without friction
but it is still the same sensation.

Luckily I managed to put most of my fears related to my level of
coding skill to rest. The trick was simple, be good at what you do.
Now that may sounds obvious but let me explain. I hope we both can
agree that a term I like is applicable to your skills as a software
developer. That term is "reasonable expectations". Why is this
important? It is important because when you feel like you are not good
enough, I argue that the first thing to ask is if you are meeting
reasonable expectations given your situation. We can almost always
be better than we are but when you are doing work what matters is
if your results stand in proportion to the role you have.

Once I started thinking less about how much worse I am at my job
than the true masters of software development and I started to thinking
about how good my results are in comparison with others at my level,
a big portion of my fears vanished.
I will not go as far as to say that this will remove all your fear.
After all each of us feel things in our own way and you may want to
consider medical help if you find yourself crippled by your anxiety.
However, I would like to think that the best medicine for impostor
syndrome is to work hard at your craft until you know that you can
meet the expectations of the projects you work on.

Remember, you can always be better but it is important to look
at where you are right now. You need stop a little bit and reflect
on if you are good enough for your level or not. Regardless of how
you feel your best bet is to accept that the fear of not being good
enough will always be there and the way forward is to understand what
productive actions you can take to feel more confident. When you Practices
this approach you will hopefully understand that just as how you
are now no longer afraid of some things you used to be afraid of,
you can view the impostor syndrome the same way. It is a fear that
is cured best by improving yourself until you feel that you can do
what you are afraid of well enough for it to no longer be an
obstacle for you.

## How to Pass the Trial Period at a New Job?

For those of you who work in regions where this is not a custom.
Trial periods is a period of time in the start of your employment
where the company have certain legal rights they will lose once
it is over. Usually this is related to how easy it is to terminate
the employment but it can differ.

My viewpoint is mostly the same regardless if you are in the start
of the employment or far in to it. I suggest the following:

- Raise your positive attitude by 40%
- Suggest rather than being strongly opinionated
- Treat your coworkers as a clerk in a shop would

The way I summarize this is to adopt a persona that suits your
personality. Many people in popular work culture advocates for
letting your hair down and being yourself. I argue that only
people who are the right version of whatever their boss and
coworkers define as pleasant can afford that luxury.
For the rest of us it is better to remember that there are always
conditions for how well you do in any situation. At work your
best option is usually to remember that the quality of your work
is not the only thing that matters. How people feel about your
matters in equal measure so if you are not fortunate enough to
love everyone and have everyone love you back you can at least
remind yourself that to some extent you will need to fit in.

My persona is derived from the Shrek character Donkey. I know
that smiling and trying to be someone who encourages my ideas
without becoming unpleasant when I am not being taken seriously
is a way of behaving that is a sweet-spot between how I am in
private and what my coworkers find to be someone they can accept.

## Is It Okay to Take a Break from Studying Software Development?

Naturally, studying too much has a negative effect on knowledge
retention and study without retention seems ineffective to me.

There is a common myth in software development. The myth about
the software developer who does nothing but code. What is worse
is that some in the community seem to believe that this is what
is considered a prerequisite for finding work.

There are companies who have hiring policies that may seem like
the lifestyle of those developer who spend their free time working
on open source projects or are active in other areas of the community.
However, it is important to take note of something if you ask me.
When you watch tech talks, count how many people are in the audience
and how many speakers there is on stage. It is easy to forget that
most of the people who work as software developer are just regular
people doing a job.

I believe that we should give thanks to those in the community
with the drive to go above and beyond what is required to do
good work in our respective companies but it would be a great
disservice to them and to the rest of us if we started treating
their efforts as the norm.

## How can you provide constructive feedback to developers?

I usually handle this in two different ways and the method
differs slightly depending on if I am a fellow developer in
the team or if I am in a position of authority such as being
the Tech lead or similar. The reason is because depending
on my role the requirements on my work and the expectations
I can put on my coworkers makes most people perceive my
feedback differently.

Most commonly I simply provide my feedback as a alternative
option and I highlight what it is about my suggestion that
makes me like it and what I may not like about it.
I try to avoid focusing too much on what is wrong about the
approach my coworker is taking until I see that the discussion
is stretching out due to that we view things differently and feel
somewhat equally deep about the subject.

The key element here is that when I am a fellow software developer
I don't want to attempt to force my coworker to do things my way.
I want the subject to be approved collectively. The reason for this
is that if I take an opposing view to my coworker and we can't see
eye to eye we can quickly cause tension between us. This is not
the case if I can see that we can't agree and I simply suggest
we raise it with a third party and vote on the subject or take
the view of whoever is in a position of more authority. This
may seem counterintuitive to us who are engineers and are taught
that there is a right way to make things but what I like to point
out is that there is more than one way to do most things and even
if you know of a superior way that won't matter much if the other
developers can't see the value and follow your train of thought.
What is even worse is that you may find yourself being fired in
an extreme case over the very changes you try to force people in
to and then what was the point? Consider that all it takes for your
ideas to fall apart is that someone who feels like you do comes
after and simply undoes your work. Again, what is the point of
forcing people to do things your way if it does not benefit you?

The key observation here is that your best move is almost always
to propose a viewpoint and see if the idea gains traction or at
the very least people are willing to hear you out. If there is no
headway made with this approach proceed with caution and really think
about if your view is so important that whatever benefits you gain
from getting your way are worth the potential consequences.

This is my guiding principles when I provide feedback to a developer.
As a rule I simply suggest, make my case on why I suggest what I do
and then we decide as a group what seems to be the best approach.
The only time I change this pattern is if I have an obligation due
to my role that forces me to take a stance on something the team may
oppose. A trivial example is testing. If I work as the Tech lead and
our teams stakeholders have an issue with quality, then I explain
to my team that writing tests is expected and not a subject for debate.
How we write them and what we use to do so we can debate but doing
it is a expectation.
I take this stance because at times you may need to provide feedback
that is not welcome and as mentioned previously, you may need to
encourage a change but without authority you can't force someone
to do things how you want without good reason.

## What Should You Know Before Starting Your Own IT Company?

I have found that the main things are:

- Do you have a paying customer
- Do you know how to expectations

It is important that you understand that making money from software
has a few natural phases.
The first phase is the proof of concept. This is where you need to
understand who will use your software and how you will make money
from it. Most companies struggle to become profitable and a project
that won't make any money until it is already several years in to
it's growth is going to make it though to survive while you are
building it. Make sure you don't underestimate how important it
is to not only be excited about making great software but also
about finding people willing to pay for the work you do.

The next thing to think about is that you need to be able to
deliver on expectations. A flaw that a lot of engineers have
is the idea of quality and how important it is. It is one of
the rare occasions where I advocate for taking a page from
the entrepreneurs of the world and stop being overly concerned
with how well your code is made and rather be concerned with if
your customers are happy with the results.
Software developers often forget that their company will be able
to improve the quality of it's code as long as they are willing
to invest time and money in it but if you have no money you
will not. Never forget that some of the most successful companies
are not necessarily the companies behind the most state of the art
software.

The second phase is when you start to grow. This is when you need
to be mindful that you grow at a pace that you can sustain.
As you hire more people you need to keep a focus on where the
money comes from and do what you can to ensure that the people
you gather to help your business grow are increasing the cashflow.
It is common that as your company grows you get various perspectives
on how you should run things. However you want to run your company
is up to you and your peers but remember to always keep an eye on
what is paying the bills and how the choices you make impact that
because no matter how you slice it the others who are part of your
companies journey may leave if they don't get their way but they
will also leave if you don't pay them.

## What’s the best way to address performance issues?

This is a tricky one and all I can say is that it will always
depend on the specific situation. The main thing I want to
propose to you before we go further is to consider if the
performance issue you see in someone is a real problem or
if it simply feels like they could do better. I have often
found myself and others around me question someones productivity
and I just as many probably can relate to, have feel frustrated
over what I have seen. However, I think it is worth asking how
often you have felt the same frustration over the performance
of people in other situations. I can imagine that there are
many chefs around the world who goes to a restaurant and
are appalled by the quality of the food. Yet I am willing
to be that had I eaten the food I would probably feel pretty
happy about a lot of the dishes served. The point I am making
is that what we consider good performance and bad performance
will always be subjective but the real question is if the person
doing the work does it well enough to meet the expectations
of the people who depend on it. You can always argue that there
is someone who can do it better and often you will be right but
for the most part we don't need, and likely can't find, the person
who will be the very best at something so we settle for someone
who is good enough.

When I need to provide feedback on performance I usually start
by figuring out what the core issue is. I argue that there are
things that a company can in a reasonable time fix so the
main issues are no longer a concern but there are also things
that may take too long or require too much to be a viable option.

If I find that the core issue is with a specific tool or process
that seems hard to grasp, then I am pretty happy. This is usually
something that can be fixed by helping the developer with some
coaching sessions.
However, if the issue is that they struggle to solve programming
problems and I can see that this is a repeating patterns, it
is something that is of concern.

Usually in cases like these I try to hand-pick work that may
be simpler to see if the situation improves. If it does we
can try to work something out. However, if the issues remain
I usually recommend that an action plan is made with some
evaluation period to determine if the developer can raise
their skill level to an acceptable level. In some cases this
is enough but sadly I may need to replace the developer if
the situation does not improve.

## How to Deal with Engineers Seeking Promotions Too Soon?

I have always favoured a merit based approach in matters that
involve authority and compensation. In my view the only
case where we can consider a promotion to come too early
is if we lack the needed history to determine if the developer
has the needed skills to handle the new role.

If the developer in question has no proof of their ability to
handle a new promotion I find that simply speaking to them
about the role they seek and what that role will require is
enough to make them ponder if they do in fact have the skills
needed. Usually I suggest that the developer and the manager
agree on a set of activities that can act as evaluation examples
of the developer so they have a honest chance to prove that they
are able to handle the role.

Companies tend to treat the matter of promotion a bit different
than I would like and it is not uncommon that there is in fact
no plan for how to deal with the subject. This is why I suggest
that any company that intends to provide career development to
their developer have some idea of how to evaluate the developers
who want to progress. More often than not I have found that
moving away from old models where the company only promotes
people based on their time spent in the company or by how
important their role has been is a good first step.

The model I have found to work best is to treat the promotion just
as hiring a new candidate. Figure out what roles you have need of
and don't promote people unless you truly need the role. When
you have the need, figure out how you would evaluate a new hire
for the position and allow the developers seeking the promotion
to be evaluated in the same manner. This has the benefit of being
a less biased way of staffing and it raises up the people who
can show that they have the right skills needed to do well in
a given role.

## Why Do Development Teams Love Agile?

I would not go as far as to say all of us love it.
To my mind it is a topic of debate and will probably never be
a settled matter. Agile, just as any other process has it's time
in the spotlight and I am sure that whatever comes after will be
just as debated as Agile is today.

The key elements that makes any project successful has, in my
view, very little to do with a work framework and more to do
with an equal part of good team rituals and good teamwork.
These concepts are not unique to Agile and most development
teams usually find a way to do work regardless of what work
framework they use. Since the topic of Agile vs other approaches
is still under debate, I feel it is safe to say that Agile so
far has not been proven to provide any definitive benefit that
you can't get by other means.

I see more teams go through the motions of Agile than I see
truly effective processes and in my view, that is due to the
inherit problem with a mental framework someone else made up
for you. Copy pasting a solution someone else has shown you
is in my view less effective than taking the time to understand
how you can make sure that the practical matters you need in place
during your work are there when they need to be. I suggest that
what development teams love is not Agile but rather rituals and
team norms that make sense to them. So far no one I have worked
with feels that all things Agile is a good idea and so I simply
suggest that you pick what works and leave the rest.

I can't really speak for others but I suspect the positive feedback
people get is similar to how people struggling with being overweight.
When people who mean well, see someone taking a risk to improve their
life, the natural response for many is to praise them. After all they
are taking charge of their life and going out fixing something.
The praise is intended to make you feel good, not think rationally.
There is no harm done here since we should in my view separate the
two. You can praise someone for doing something to improve and you
can tell them if what they are trying is realistic without one
harming the other. It is a fine balance naturally, since some people
would prefer to feel good rather than be realistic. Though it is
worth knowing that pessimistic views can often be disguised as
realistic thinking.

Ageism is not something exclusive to IT. It is also not much
different from other prejudices various groups face in the market.
I find that the real determining factor for if a candidates age has
any meaningful impact is not the number of years they have lived but
rather what type of person they have become during those years.
I have seen people of a distinguished age get work in everything
that the fresh graduates get. I can't recall any interview I have been
to where the topic of the candidates age came in to question.

As you can imagine, my experiences are by no means an absolute truth
when we discuss the subject of ageism. I am certain that there are
people who wrinkle their noses in disgust at CV's where the candidate
has one too many wrinkles on their face. I like to imagine that as
they do they carefully check that there is no bald spot emerging nor
any crowfeet peaking out from under their makeup.

If you are subjected to these sorts of people my best advice is to
do what we all do. Try again with another company. If you have the
skills and you have a lovable personality with a spare smile for
the people you greet in the interview, most rational people will
seriously consider you for the position.

## What to Do When You Can’t Make Progress on a Project?

I suppose that depends on what the nature of the blockage is.
After all, if you find it hard to solve a bug your approach
will be different than if you have a problem figuring out
how to write the code you need. There are naturally more ways
than these to get blocked but for the sake of argument I will
try to focus on these two.

When I am stuck on a bug I find the simplest way to figure out
how to solve it is by trying to isolate the area where the issue
is. This often just means that I try to replicate the bug on
my workstation. Once I can replicate the issue I start by checking
what the state of the system is just before the problem occurs.
You can almost think about it as how you would handle a function.
There is some input of data and I just want to know what it is
before I look at the details of the logic.

Once I know what the state is I want to find where the unexpected
result happens. This usually means that I allow the program to run
until the error has happened. Now I have a area to investigate.

Once I have an area I start going either forward or backwards in
the logic until I can narrow down where the problem is.
The process is very similar to how you use a debugger to slowly
go through each step of the program but you don't need one to
do it. It does speed things up I find though but I am known to
be too lazy at times and just use simple log statements.

The general idea is applicable when I get stuck on a feature I need
to develop. I try to remove the things I am unsure about how to do
and focus on what I know the code has to do. So I start small.
This approach fits pretty well with Test driven development and
I use this approach at times to slow down the development process
for myself. It helps a bit to write tests in cases such as these
since the test almost become like a checklist of functionality.

Once I know what parts of the feature I can handle I start trying
to make a first version of the implementation. Once I am happy
that the part I know how to do works I start with the next
requirement on the list. I keep going until I hit something
I am unsure about. With a bit of luck and a fair bit of Googling
skills, I often find that when I have segmented out implementation
details from the feature so I can just focus on simple base cases,
I often find it easier to solve my problem.

True to the "Divide and conquer" methodology, I suggest
you try to simplify your problems and solve many small
problems in iteration rather than try to tackle them
all at the same time. When you get really good at it
this becomes almost like a superpower. You learn that
you can build almost an entire feature without having
all the details upfront because you have learned how
to use mocks, interfaces and other methods for isolating
parts you don't know from parts you do know how to do.
Your stakeholders will love the fact that you can work
and get almost done when specific details may be delayed
due to scheduling issues. Once you get the details you can
just plug them in to the working code and this has been a
massive help to me many times.  

## How should developers handle disagreements with managers?

Usually I approach all my disagreements the same way regardless
of who I am disagreeing with. First I make sure that I am
emotionally detached from the topic or at least enough so I
can keep calm during the discussion. This is a key thing since
if you get too emotionally involved it gets harder to argue your
points well and it can become dangerous if you create friction
with people who have authority over you.

My personal favorite is to picture myself as a rock on a beach.
Just laying there year in and year out. There may be rain or
there may be sun, doesn't matter to me, I am just a rock.
Living my best life as all rocks should.

Next, I suggest you learn how to communicate using "I feel"
statements. This helps you formulate your thoughts in a manner
that comes off as calm and collected. At all points try to
converse in a non-hostile manner. Saying something like
"I feel that this approach may be less effective than if we
tried mine.", will usually go over better than, "No this
idea is shit. I have a better one."
By starting the argument with "I feel" you force yourself
to argue from your point of view and you remove an unintended
assumptions you may otherwise have. The assumptions I am referring
to is when you assume that what you believe is the correct
viewpoint. This is a way for you to make sure that the other
person understands that you are not assuming how they feel,
you are just stating how you feel about the subject.

Now that I know that I can calmly express how I view the subject,
it is time to present my arguments for my idea. I do this by adopting
my company persona "Donkey". Smile, polite tone and speak as if I am
helping a restaurant customer pick their dinner.

Once I have presented my view I almost always end with these words.
"This is of course just how I look at it and perhaps you feel differently."
This messages my peer in the argument that it is time for them to
step in and continue the conversation. What I want is a nice flow
to the conversation. A good flow builds comfort and reduces the chance
of unnecessary escalations. The last thing I want is to get in to a
shouting match over who is the most right with someone. What I think
in private, that is my business but at work I want to be "Donkey".

This process goes back and forth until both sides have presented their
views to the satisfaction or boredom of the group, now comes the time
to move forward. Usually you will find some common ground and the best
case is if you get the benefit of doubt from your peers so they are
fine with trying your approach. I usually say that if it is too hard
to sell a big idea, sell a small one to try out so we can see if we
like it. This is easier to argue for and gets the same results.

My last tip, pick your battles. There is no point in winning an
argument if you end up losing your job over it. Stand up for
yourself and be who you are but don't let pride get in the way.
You may be right about everything you say but sadly you live in
a world where people a lot less intelligent, good looking and
above all else humble get their way even though they are wrong
about everything.

# How to navigate decision-making in tech teams?

I refer to my approach as an "Expert democracy".
I know that I am almost always right about all my great ideas
but sadly, in their delusions of grandeur, my "peers" think
the same. While I internally curse their arrogance to question
me, I sadly have to admit that it won't look good for me if
I try to lay down the law.

Luckily enough, most developers are rational people so I suggest
that we have a good old fashion argument. This is why soft skills
become increasingly important for your career. You quickly learn
that if you want the right stack or the right work situation you
need to get people to listen to you before you get to use your
coding skills for anything meaningful.

Once we have argued our point we weigh the experience level and
relevance of knowledge in the group. This means that the voice
of whoever makes the best argument and has the most experience
usually gets the most traction on their viewpoint.

Finally we vote and regardless of if we agree or not we always
try to structure our decision so we can start small and scale up
if it is a new concept we introduce. If it is a different way
of working, we hate our peers internally for forcing us to write
code in some bs way while lamenting their stupidity. Often
while trying to take a calming bath.

## How to Deal with Impostor Syndrome in Software Development?

In my experience people are on a spectrum of how much impostor
syndrome affects them. Some of us seem nearly immune to it
and some are crippled by it. I know senior developers who have
a long history of major achievements in the field and they still
feel insecure about their abilities. What I am trying to say is
that all I can give you my tip on how I managed to overcome
impostor syndrome but you should look at it as a fear to be
overcome rather than something that you expect to go away
forever. It's a bit like overcoming fear of heights. You may
be fine going up a high building but if we put you on a tightrope
hovering a fall that would mean instant death on impact you
will probably see your life flash.

The key to overcoming impostor syndrome for me was when I finally
understood that I could meet the expectations of the industry.
I reflected on my journey thus far and came to realize that
although I was by no means the best developer who has ever lived,
I did know enough to make my deadlines. I did know how to fix
the bugs the system had. I did know that I could estimate roughly
how much time it would take me to build something that needed to
be built. In short, I had reached a point where the work of a
developer no longer held anything uncertain or scary for me.

I urge you to think in similar terms. If you feel confident in
that you can meet the expectations of your stakeholders at least
admit to yourself that you are good enough to do that much.
Sure you can be better and with practice you will be but at least
admit that you have the needed value to do the job. When I acknowledged
to myself that in fact, I did know how to do the job well enough, nearly
all anxiety faded. I would not go as far as saying that I had none
left, there is always some anxiety to spare for those days when
I least need it but at least on average I felt pretty good.

I suggest that the way to overcome the impostor syndrome is
to work at your craft until you feel that you can deliver
working software in accordance with expectations. Once you
know that you can, what remains is your own insecurity over
not being even better. At that point I suggest you acknowledge
that you may always to some extent feel that you could be better
and I hope you use that anxiety to keep learning. However, allow
yourself to at least feel good about that you have gone from someone
who can't write a single line of code to someone who can do it at a
professional level. That is a major achievement and you are allowed
to feel good about it.

I believe fear is best handled by exposure. If you build confidence
in whatever you are scared of you will see that fear hold less control
over you. So do just that, practice. Learn the trade, get a job,
do it and when you have done it for a while, acknowledge that you
may still feel anxious about some things but you have at least made
progress.

## What’s the best way to address performance issues in developers?

I view performance issues as two categories. Low investment and
high investment. I make a habit of looking at the practical skills
each developer has in my team so I can estimate how likely the
person in question will be to raise their ability in whatever
they are lagging behind in. By putting the practical skills
in to these categories I can get a feeling for if the best
approach is to provide training or if I need to escalate
the issue. Whichever approach I go with I make sure to
leave my own frustration at the door. It is important to
remember that no matter how you feel about the performance
of the developer, getting upset about it won't benefit you.

If I find that the core issue is that they lack the needed
experience with a certain concept or process, I am pretty
happy. This is what I would call a low investment since
learning new tools is bread and butter for any software
developer who want's to be relevant. So long as the developer
has the right attitude and is willing to learn we can work
with this.

However, if the core issue is that they struggle to ship code
and I can see that there is no clear pattern to what they find
tricky but rather it seems that whatever they are tasked with
is a struggle, then we in for a tougher choice. I usually
try to allocate simpler and simpler tasks to the developer
before I escalate. This gives us a chance to see if they
perhaps are just matched poorly with the work and would do
better with different type of work.

When the practical skills needed to fix fall in the high
investment category, I need to escalate to resolve the issue.
The reason for this is that when a developer has performance
issues across the board there is no telling if they will ever
reach a higher level of productivity or how long it will take
them to improve enough to meet at least basic expectations.
This means that the manager will need to make a judgement call
about the situation. If the team is fine with having someone
who is not meeting their expectation we can simply continue as
is but if we need to raise their productivity we need to align
on by how much and when it simply is better to look at other
candidates to fill the role.

The most common strategy at this point is to provide the candidate
with the feedback and create a work plan for them with some form
of evaluation deadline. This is not something you can do without
having an effect on morale usually. I suggest you limit the feedback
to the candidate so not to shame them. Simply talk to them in private
and take it from there.
