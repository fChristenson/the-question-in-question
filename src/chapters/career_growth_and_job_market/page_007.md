## How Do Career Ladders In It Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.

## How Should Developers Handle Disagreements With Managers?

I have always favoured what I call the expert democracy.
The core of my argument is that any difference of opinion
needs to start with some shared values about what makes someone
correct or incorrect on a subject. If both sides can agree that
there are factors that can determine if someones argument is more
valid than another, progress can be made. If neither side can
agree on what determines if someone is correct no progress can
be made.

As software developers we have some common values that naturally
come up in most decisions we make. Time is a big one, if something
will help us save time we often agree that it has value. Quality
is another one, we most of the time agree that quality matters
to some point. These values are what we need to agree on matters
in order for us to argue for or against something in a practical
way.

If your manager feels differently from you about a subject your
best move most of the time is to argue from a value perspective.
Present what your thoughts are and try to position your argument
from the values you share with your manager. Time and quality are
often simple areas to argue from since they are easy to comprehend
for people regardless of their technical understanding.

However, there is a key element that you need to understand and
that is perhaps the most underestimated truth of engineering.
Any successful marketing enthusiast or sales representative will
likely vouch for that before you can discuss where to put your
time and money you need the people in charge to be open to
try what your are proposing. If they don't agree with you it does
not matter how amazing your ideas are, they will never happen
as long as the people your are talking to are blocking your effort.

For us software developers the same obstacle will be in play. If
your manager wants to do something other than you, persuasion is
your most viable option. If you can't persuade them you will need
to pick your fights and move on. It is sadly not uncommon for people
with amazing ideas to be shut down by people who simply don't agree
and are not persuaded by the arguments presented.
This is why you should never underestimate the value of strong
social skills, a good reputation and above all, knowing how to win
peoples trust. These are tools just as valuable as the tools you
use to write code because without them you may never get to write
the code in the way you want or use the tools of your choice.

## How Should Developers Navigate Decision Making In Tech Teams?

I would say this is the most underestimated skill of the job.
Most choices have multiple ways paths forward. So how do you
make the rights ones and perhaps just as importantly, how
do you make others see your point of view.

My best tip is to consider how a democracy works. If you
all agree that there is a range of choices to be made then
your next step is to evaluate what choices holds the most
promise. If you are lucky you are left with one choice that
you all agree one. If you are not so fortunate you will need
to pick. This is where a simple vote usually is the best way.

The trick to getting the democratic approach to work in tech
is to reduce the cost of failure as much as is possible.
Most people who feel strongly about something usually view
things from the perspective of how things will look in a best
or worst case. However it is rare that their idea of what will
be or not be is as clean cut as they make it up to be.
We software developers know that it is nearly impossible to
predict exactly how long something takes or how well a solution
will work given enough time. That is why we try to reduce the scope
of what we deliver since we know that the less that is in scope
the easier it is for us to estimate and measure.

I argue that you should approach your own technical decisions
the same way. Agree to disagree on a choice, vote on it and then
allow whoever wins the vote to prove their idea with a small
experiment. This gives the opposing side a chance to evaluate
the choice without blocking any progress and it gives the side
advocating the choice a chance to prove that their idea will work.

This approach removes much of the fear of making a poor choice
and it allows you to try out a choice and see if it works. If
the benefits you expect are shown in the experiment you can feel
confident in expanding the scope of the idea. However, if they
are not there you can evaluate the options again and this time
your viewpoints may be different from the first time.
