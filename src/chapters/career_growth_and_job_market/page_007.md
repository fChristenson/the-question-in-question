## How Do Career Ladders In IT Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.
