## How Do Career Ladders In IT Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.

## What to Do When You Can’t Make Progress on a Project?

I usually ask for help from my coworkers, if I am fortunate
enough to have any to ask. I have never been a big believer
in that asking for help is a sign of weakness. The main thing
is to respect others time by showing that you put real effort
in to solving your own problems and then showing genuine
gratitude when you receive help.

Usually a bit of rubber ducking with a coworker is enough
to give me a lead on how to solve my problem but if even
both of us are at a loss for how to solve the issue I
search for answers on the web. With a bit of luck I can
find someone who has posted a question on a forum that
is similar to my own. It doesn't have to be exactly my
problem, just something that gives me a hint of what
could be the solution to my problem.

Lastly, I always try to divide and conquer my problems.
Usually I find that if I can reduce the size of my problem
I can narrow in on the general area where I am facing issues.
A concrete example would be if I have a bug and I can't figure
out what part of the code is causing it. My first step is to
find at what point in the program the bug has happened.
Once I know that I start stepping backwards in the program
until I find the point where the bug is not there.
I continue this approach, sort of like a binary search,
until I find where the bug has started. This helps me
isolate the problem and often this is enough to help me.
The same approach works for most things. If you have to deal
with a big feature or a big bug, slice it down to the smallest
possible size and then start by solving the first part.
When you can get something simple to work, take the next part.

## How Should Developers Handle Disagreements With Managers?

I have always favoured what I call the expert democracy.
The core of my argument is that any difference of opinion
needs to start with some shared values about what makes someone
correct or incorrect on a subject. If both sides can agree that
there are factors that can determine if someones argument is more
valid than another, progress can be made. If neither side can
agree on what determines if someone is correct no progress can
be made.

As software developers we have some common values that naturally
come up in most decisions we make. Time is a big one, if something
will help us save time we often agree that it has value. Quality
is another one, we most of the time agree that quality matters
to some point. These values are what we need to agree on matters
in order for us to argue for or against something in a practical
way.

If your manager feels differently from you about a subject your
best move most of the time is to argue from a value perspective.
Present what your thoughts are and try to position your argument
from the values you share with your manager. Time and quality are
often simple areas to argue from since they are easy to comprehend
for people regardless of their technical understanding.

However, there is a key element that you need to understand and
that is perhaps the most underestimated truth of engineering.
Any successful marketing enthusiast or sales representative will
likely vouch for that before you can discuss where to put your
time and money you need the people in charge to be open to
try what your are proposing. If they don't agree with you it does
not matter how amazing your ideas are, they will never happen
as long as the people your are talking to are blocking your effort.

For us software developers the same obstacle will be in play. If
your manager wants to do something other than you, persuasion is
your most viable option. If you can't persuade them you will need
to pick your fights and move on. It is sadly not uncommon for people
with amazing ideas to be shut down by people who simply don't agree
and are not persuaded by the arguments presented.
This is why you should never underestimate the value of strong
social skills, a good reputation and above all, knowing how to win
peoples trust. These are tools just as valuable as the tools you
use to write code because without them you may never get to write
the code in the way you want or use the tools of your choice.

## How Should Developers Navigate Decision Making In Tech Teams?

I would say this is the most underestimated skill of the job.
Most choices have multiple ways paths forward. So how do you
make the rights ones and perhaps just as importantly, how
do you make others see your point of view.

My best tip is to consider how a democracy works. If you
all agree that there is a range of choices to be made then
your next step is to evaluate what choices holds the most
promise. If you are lucky you are left with one choice that
you all agree one. If you are not so fortunate you will need
to pick. This is where a simple vote usually is the best way.

The trick to getting the democratic approach to work in tech
is to reduce the cost of failure as much as is possible.
Most people who feel strongly about something usually view
things from the perspective of how things will look in a best
or worst case. However it is rare that their idea of what will
be or not be is as clean cut as they make it up to be.
We software developers know that it is nearly impossible to
predict exactly how long something takes or how well a solution
will work given enough time. That is why we try to reduce the scope
of what we deliver since we know that the less that is in scope
the easier it is for us to estimate and measure.

I argue that you should approach your own technical decisions
the same way. Agree to disagree on a choice, vote on it and then
allow whoever wins the vote to prove their idea with a small
experiment. This gives the opposing side a chance to evaluate
the choice without blocking any progress and it gives the side
advocating the choice a chance to prove that their idea will work.

This approach removes much of the fear of making a poor choice
and it allows you to try out a choice and see if it works. If
the benefits you expect are shown in the experiment you can feel
confident in expanding the scope of the idea. However, if they
are not there you can evaluate the options again and this time
your viewpoints may be different from the first time.

## What Would You Say to a CEO Who Belittles Your Work?

Not much. I have been on the opposing side of enough people
to feel comfortable being doubted. I expect to be treated with
the respect anyone is due regardless of who I speak to but further
than that I don't push my expectations on other people.

Given that the CEO in question has some ideas on what my work
is lacking, I am more than happy to hear them. I have made a
note of never becoming too sure of that I am correct about what
I believe. The method I have used for years is to simply keep
all code I ever wrote since my school days so that when I get
too full of myself I can go back and see the quality of work
I used to do. The experience is unpleasant and cringe worthy
but it does help for me.

Once I have an idea of what the issue the CEO has is with my
work I ask myself the only question I ever really ponder when
questions of performance become a topic of review.
The question is "given our current situation, are these results
within reasonable expectations?".
The power of this question is best described with an example I
like to use. If you hire a company of movers to move your
belongings, there are reasonable expectations to consider.
Odds or that a group of average people will show up to your
door and do the work. If you expect them to be bodybuilders
your expectations are probably not realistic. However, if a group
of frail people who can barely move anything appears, it is
reasonable to expect more from people who move things professionally.

If the CEO expects high results and they don't have an understanding
of what is realistic, why would I care about their viewpoint. At
best it is a viewpoint of someone who doesn't have realistic
expectations and so arguing with them is pointless. I simply
try my best to explain why the results look as they do.
I find that this usually is enough for a rationally minded person
and then we make a action plan to improve the situation.
However, if the CEO is not a reasonable person and is simply
out to vent frustration I ask myself if I am overall happy with
how my place of work treats me. If I am, I treat the CEO as any
person I don't get along with but want to have a professional
relationship with. Otherwise I look at my options and move on.

## How to Deal with Impostor Syndrome in Software Development?

Probably the most common insecurity of any developer is the feeling
of not being as good as you need to be.
To this day I am not completely rid of the feeling of anxiety
that comes from not being able to meet expectations.
It has changed from being about my level of coding to being more
about my ability to interact without stakeholders without friction
but it is still the same sensation.

Luckily I managed to put most of my fears related to my level of
coding skill to rest. The trick was simple, be good at what you do.
Now that may sounds obvious but let me explain. I hope we both can
agree that a term I like is applicable to your skills as a software
developer. That term is "reasonable expectations". Why is this
important? It is important because when you feel like you are not good
enough, I argue that the first thing to ask is if you are meeting
reasonable expectations given your situation. We can almost always
be better than we are but when you are doing work what matters is
if your results stand in proportion to the role you have.

Once I started thinking less about how much worse I am at my job
than the true masters of software development and I started to thinking
about how good my results are in comparison with others at my level,
a big portion of my fears vanished.
I will not go as far as to say that this will remove all your fear.
After all each of us feel things in our own way and you may want to
consider medical help if you find yourself crippled by your anxiety.
However, I would like to think that the best medicine for impostor
syndrome is to work hard at your craft until you know that you can
meet the expectations of the projects you work on.

Remember, you can always be better but it is important to look
at where you are right now. You need stop a little bit and reflect
on if you are good enough for your level or not. Regardless of how
you feel your best bet is to accept that the fear of not being good
enough will always be there and the way forward is to understand what
productive actions you can take to feel more confident. When you Practices
this approach you will hopefully understand that just as how you
are now no longer afraid of some things you used to be afraid of,
you can view the impostor syndrome the same way. It is a fear that
is cured best by improving yourself until you feel that you can do
what you are afraid of well enough for it to no longer be an
obstacle for you.

## How to Pass the Trial Period at a New Job?

For those of you who work in regions where this is not a custom.
Trial periods is a period of time in the start of your employment
where the company have certain legal rights they will lose once
it is over. Usually this is related to how easy it is to terminate
the employment but it can differ.

My viewpoint is mostly the same regardless if you are in the start
of the employment or far in to it. I suggest the following:

- Raise your positive attitude by 40%
- Suggest rather than being strongly opinionated
- Treat your coworkers as a clerk in a shop would

The way I summarize this is to adopt a persona that suits your
personality. Many people in popular work culture advocates for
letting your hair down and being yourself. I argue that only
people who are the right version of whatever their boss and
coworkers define as pleasant can afford that luxury.
For the rest of us it is better to remember that there are always
conditions for how well you do in any situation. At work your
best option is usually to remember that the quality of your work
is not the only thing that matters. How people feel about your
matters in equal measure so if you are not fortunate enough to
love everyone and have everyone love you back you can at least
remind yourself that to some extent you will need to fit in.

My persona is derived from the Shrek character Donkey. I know
that smiling and trying to be someone who encourages my ideas
without becoming unpleasant when I am not being taken seriously
is a way of behaving that is a sweet-spot between how I am in
private and what my coworkers find to be someone they can accept.

## Is It Okay to Take a Break from Studying Software Development?

Naturally, studying too much has a negative effect on knowledge
retention and study without retention seems ineffective to me.

There is a common myth in software development. The myth about
the software developer who does nothing but code. What is worse
is that some in the community seem to believe that this is what
is considered a prerequisite for finding work.

There are companies who have hiring policies that may seem like
the lifestyle of those developer who spend their free time working
on open source projects or are active in other areas of the community.
However, it is important to take note of something if you ask me.
When you watch tech talks, count how many people are in the audience
and how many speakers there is on stage. It is easy to forget that
most of the people who work as software developer are just regular
people doing a job.

I believe that we should give thanks to those in the community
with the drive to go above and beyond what is required to do
good work in our respective companies but it would be a great
disservice to them and to the rest of us if we started treating
their efforts as the norm.

## How can you provide constructive feedback to developers?

I usually handle this in two different ways and the method
differs slightly depending on if I am a fellow developer in
the team or if I am in a position of authority such as being
the Tech lead or similar. The reason is because depending
on my role the requirements on my work and the expectations
I can put on my coworkers makes most people perceive my
feedback differently.

Most commonly I simply provide my feedback as a alternative
option and I highlight what it is about my suggestion that
makes me like it and what I may not like about it.
I try to avoid focusing too much on what is wrong about the
approach my coworker is taking until I see that the discussion
is stretching out due to that we view things differently and feel
somewhat equally deep about the subject.

The key element here is that when I am a fellow software developer
I don't want to attempt to force my coworker to do things my way.
I want the subject to be approved collectively. The reason for this
is that if I take an opposing view to my coworker and we can't see
eye to eye we can quickly cause tension between us. This is not
the case if I can see that we can't agree and I simply suggest
we raise it with a third party and vote on the subject or take
the view of whoever is in a position of more authority. This
may seem counterintuitive to us who are engineers and are taught
that there is a right way to make things but what I like to point
out is that there is more than one way to do most things and even
if you know of a superior way that won't matter much if the other
developers can't see the value and follow your train of thought.
What is even worse is that you may find yourself being fired in
an extreme case over the very changes you try to force people in
to and then what was the point? Consider that all it takes for your
ideas to fall apart is that someone who feels like you do comes
after and simply undoes your work. Again, what is the point of
forcing people to do things your way if it does not benefit you?

The key observation here is that your best move is almost always
to propose a viewpoint and see if the idea gains traction or at
the very least people are willing to hear you out. If there is no
headway made with this approach proceed with caution and really think
about if your view is so important that whatever benefits you gain
from getting your way are worth the potential consequences.

This is my guiding principles when I provide feedback to a developer.
As a rule I simply suggest, make my case on why I suggest what I do
and then we decide as a group what seems to be the best approach.
The only time I change this pattern is if I have an obligation due
to my role that forces me to take a stance on something the team may
oppose. A trivial example is testing. If I work as the Tech lead and
our teams stakeholders have an issue with quality, then I explain
to my team that writing tests is expected and not a subject for debate.
How we write them and what we use to do so we can debate but doing
it is a expectation.
I take this stance because at times you may need to provide feedback
that is not welcome and as mentioned previously, you may need to
encourage a change but without authority you can't force someone
to do things how you want without good reason.
