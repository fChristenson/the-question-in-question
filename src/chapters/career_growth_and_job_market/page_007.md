## How Do Career Ladders In IT Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.

## What to Do When You Can’t Make Progress on a Project?

I usually ask for help from my coworkers, if I am fortunate
enough to have any to ask. I have never been a big believer
in that asking for help is a sign of weakness. The main thing
is to respect others time by showing that you put real effort
in to solving your own problems and then showing genuine
gratitude when you receive help.

Usually a bit of rubber ducking with a coworker is enough
to give me a lead on how to solve my problem but if even
both of us are at a loss for how to solve the issue I
search for answers on the web. With a bit of luck I can
find someone who has posted a question on a forum that
is similar to my own. It doesn't have to be exactly my
problem, just something that gives me a hint of what
could be the solution to my problem.

Lastly, I always try to divide and conquer my problems.
Usually I find that if I can reduce the size of my problem
I can narrow in on the general area where I am facing issues.
A concrete example would be if I have a bug and I can't figure
out what part of the code is causing it. My first step is to
find at what point in the program the bug has happened.
Once I know that I start stepping backwards in the program
until I find the point where the bug is not there.
I continue this approach, sort of like a binary search,
until I find where the bug has started. This helps me
isolate the problem and often this is enough to help me.
The same approach works for most things. If you have to deal
with a big feature or a big bug, slice it down to the smallest
possible size and then start by solving the first part.
When you can get something simple to work, take the next part.

## How Should Developers Handle Disagreements With Managers?

I have always favoured what I call the expert democracy.
The core of my argument is that any difference of opinion
needs to start with some shared values about what makes someone
correct or incorrect on a subject. If both sides can agree that
there are factors that can determine if someones argument is more
valid than another, progress can be made. If neither side can
agree on what determines if someone is correct no progress can
be made.

As software developers we have some common values that naturally
come up in most decisions we make. Time is a big one, if something
will help us save time we often agree that it has value. Quality
is another one, we most of the time agree that quality matters
to some point. These values are what we need to agree on matters
in order for us to argue for or against something in a practical
way.

If your manager feels differently from you about a subject your
best move most of the time is to argue from a value perspective.
Present what your thoughts are and try to position your argument
from the values you share with your manager. Time and quality are
often simple areas to argue from since they are easy to comprehend
for people regardless of their technical understanding.

However, there is a key element that you need to understand and
that is perhaps the most underestimated truth of engineering.
Any successful marketing enthusiast or sales representative will
likely vouch for that before you can discuss where to put your
time and money you need the people in charge to be open to
try what your are proposing. If they don't agree with you it does
not matter how amazing your ideas are, they will never happen
as long as the people your are talking to are blocking your effort.

For us software developers the same obstacle will be in play. If
your manager wants to do something other than you, persuasion is
your most viable option. If you can't persuade them you will need
to pick your fights and move on. It is sadly not uncommon for people
with amazing ideas to be shut down by people who simply don't agree
and are not persuaded by the arguments presented.
This is why you should never underestimate the value of strong
social skills, a good reputation and above all, knowing how to win
peoples trust. These are tools just as valuable as the tools you
use to write code because without them you may never get to write
the code in the way you want or use the tools of your choice.
