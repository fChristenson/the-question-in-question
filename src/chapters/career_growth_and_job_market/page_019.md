## What About Trainee Developer Positions?

This is can be a great way to get a foothold in the industry.
However, it is worth knowing what to look for before you accept.

On more than a few occasions, I have seen soon to be developers
being put in tough situations where their managers don't understand
that being a trainee means that you need as much, if not more, support
as a junior software developer. Some managers don't account for this
and some blatantly exploit the trainee by using them for adhoc tasks
that doesn't benefit them.

Luckily, I have a few tips for both sides of this. The key issue is
that the trainee lacks experience to just dive in and become productive.
The manager is likely not interested in reducing capacity from their
regular development teams to give support. At least, not until they
have a sense of if they want to keep the trainee or not.
So what to do?

For trainees, I suggest you ask about the work you will be doing once
you take the job. Make sure the manager is specific about it.
Your goal is to get as close as possible to the development done by
the developers already working there. You will benefit the most by
learning from them and you will need support from them to get going.

For managers, I give this advice. I have found that the best way to
get trainees productive and to gain value from their work is by looking
at peripheral projects. These are projects that are usually of lower
complexity than the core systems and they will benefit the company
but they may not be so important that you feel you should take time
from the developers working on the main codebase.
This is a perfect project for a trainee. You give them a real project
that will benefit the company and regardless of how it goes there is
no negative impact on the core projects. This is a low risk investment
that will give both parties a chance to get to know each other.

Trainees usually feel that by being in a low risk project they feel
calmer than if you put them on a big project right away and managers
can feel calm in the knowledge that, there is no risk involved in
the trainees getting a chance to show what they can do.
I believe this sort of setup will encourage more companies to consider
what "nice to have" projects they would like to make and that would
be a good match for new developers who want to try out working for
them.

## What Does It Take To Excel As A Junior Developer?

The obvious answer is to perform well with your coding
and need little to no guidance other than what your
coworkers feel is just the right amount. In theory this
is easy to do but as you can imagine, harder in reality.

My main tips will most of the time be to make sure you
try your best to solve your own issues. Respect the time
of your coworkers but also ask for help when you are truly
stuck. Showing that tiny bit of consideration will go a long
way. The rest is about being friendly, eager to learn and talent.
You can't really control talent but you can be mindful of how
you behave in the workplace and how you interact with your coworkers.
Smiling, showing consideration and engaging in a positive way with
other people can make a huge difference.

## How To Succeed As A Solo Junior Developer?

This is probably the toughest situation you can find yourself
in when you start your career as a programmer. I would advice
against being solo in the beginning but realistically it is hard
to be picky about your workplace before you get a few years in.

The main tip I can give you is to keep it simple. Stick to the
most popular choices in tech so you know there are tons of learning
materials and people who have posted solutions to various problems
online. Leverage AI systems and focus on just making things work.
There is no benefit in you trying to guess what the best solution
looks like and how more senior developers would do something.
Simply check for basic tips that you can apply and accept that
even if the code won't be as perfect as if you had years of
experience, if it works, you get to keep your job and continue
learning. That is the key to becoming senior. Deliver something
that works well enough, learn from it and repeat.

## Do Seasoned Programmers Sometimes Struggle In Interviews?

Oh, yes. Frankly speaking, it is hard to tell sometimes if I
am talking to a senior or not. People get nervous, they struggle
to answer questions and they have a hard time thinking straight.
I am a victim of all of these and so is the vast majority of
people I have done interviews with.

There is a belief that experience builds confidence and thus things
such as anxiety does not affect seniors. This is true to a point.
You do gain some confidence from knowing what you have achieved in
the past but just how much that comforts you can vary greatly.
Personal friends of mine who I count as among the best developers
I have worked with, feel like they don't measure up at times.
I argue that this is due to that they view themselves differently
than others and I am pretty sure many people you have seen doing
things such as performing on stage or in a sport, can vouch for
similar experiences. I have on several occasions heard performers
explain that before a show they still feel a bit nervous but once
they get in to their material most of it goes away.

Being a senior does not mean that you are mentally prepared for
interviews. Seniors may have more practice coding but interviews
are different. They are not just another day at the job but a
deliberate meeting for evaluation. It is similar to how people who
talk a lot may have a hard time to speak in public. It is a
different context and speaking with a few people feels different
than speaking on a stage. Interviews are very similar in this regard.
