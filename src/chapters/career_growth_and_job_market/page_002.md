## How Would You Improve The Interview Process?

It is common that developers find interview tedious or intimidating.

I usually advocate that companies structure their process with
a few guidelines. Though even doing so will probably never make
the process enjoyable to candidates but it may make it more tolerable.

Start by making a code test that takes no longer than an hour or two
to complete. The goal of a code test should be to verify that a candidate
has basic coding knowledge. The more complex you make it the more likely
you are to make life tough on the candidates.

Once you have a code test verify that it is possible for a junior
level developer to complete it. When you review a code test you will
notice if the test is barely passing or if the candidate has added
their own ideas on top. This indicates seniority.

Next, design a standard set of questions that ask about specific
practices and tools relevant to the role the candidate will have.
Ask developers about how features in their tools work and when they
pick one approach over another.
These sorts of questions allows the candidate to answer at their level.
From a junior level you will get answers that are fairly shallow in
their depth and from seniors you will be able to hear their experience
based on the depth of the answer they give.

This approach of asking questions makes it easy to avoid getting too
high level and focus on the practicals of delivering software.
This is very useful when you have candidates who tend to talk forever
about the first questions and before you know it your out of time
and you have no idea if they know how to code at all.

With these two methods of evaluation I usually suggest you ask how
much time you have. If you have a lot of time for interviews you can
go directly to the personal interview. The seniors usually prefer this
and it is by far the easiest way to figure out their level. If they
do well and you have faith that the people doing the interview are
experienced software developers who can tell who will be a good fit
and who will not, skip the test.
However, if you are dealing with large amounts of candidates or junior
developer you will usually be better off starting with the test.
It will screen out candidates who can't handle the basics.

Make sure that you always have the evaluation of the interview done
by your best and brightest developers. They need some social graces
as well so they can make the process comfortable for the candidate.
This is my personal process for interview and although it is not perfect
it is as fair as I can make it right now.

## Can Non-Passionate Developers Have Successful Careers?

Yes. Most developers are not particularly passionate about the craft.
It is a common misconception that in order to be a software developer
you need to spend a lot of time outside of work. This is true in some
cases and it is usually in the early days when you struggle to produce
working code.
However it is by no means a requirement to be up to date on all
the trends and have your own projects.

When you are a developer the things that matters is that you can
deliver code using the tools your company uses. If you manage to learn
all you need on the job then you won't need to push harder unless you
want to.
However if you are struggling to meet expectations or you find it hard
to find a new job due to that you lack knowledge. Well, then you will
need to make up the difference in your spare time most likely.

The people who are truly passionate have a lifestyle that is not for
everyone. These are the people you see on social media and conferences.
Try to remember that for every one of them there is an audience of
people who are not on stage. These people are the norm and most of
the industry is made up of people who develop software as a job but
in their spare time they may have any range of other interests.
