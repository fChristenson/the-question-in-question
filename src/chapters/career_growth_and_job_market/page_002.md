## How Would You Improve The Interview Process?

It is common that developers find interviews tedious or intimidating.

I usually advocate that companies structure their process with
a few guidelines. Though even doing so will probably never make
the process enjoyable to candidates but it may make it more tolerable.

Start by making a code test that takes no longer than an hour or two
to complete. The goal of a code test should be to verify that a candidate
has basic coding knowledge. The more complex you make it the more likely
you are to make life tough on the candidates.

Once you have a code test verify that it is possible for a junior
level developer to complete it. When you review a code test you will
notice if the test is barely passing or if the candidate has added
their own ideas on top. This indicates seniority.

Next, design a standard set of questions that ask about specific
practices and tools relevant to the role the candidate will have.
Ask developers about how features in their tools work and when they
pick one approach over another.
These sorts of questions allows the candidate to answer at their level.
From a junior level you will get answers that are fairly shallow in
their depth and from seniors you will be able to hear their experience
based on the depth of the answer they give.

This approach of asking questions makes it easy to avoid getting too
high level and focus on the practicals of delivering software.
This is very useful when you have candidates who tend to talk forever
about the first questions and before you know it your out of time
and you have no idea if they know how to code at all.

With these two methods of evaluation I usually suggest you ask how
much time you have. If you have a lot of time for interviews you can
go directly to the personal interview. The seniors usually prefer this
and it is by far the easiest way to figure out their level. If they
do well and you have faith that the people doing the interview are
experienced software developers who can tell who will be a good fit
and who will not, skip the test.
However, if you are dealing with large amounts of candidates or junior
developers you will usually be better off starting with the test.
It will screen out candidates who can't handle the basics.

Make sure that you always have the evaluation of the interview done
by your best and brightest developers. They need some social graces
as well so they can make the process comfortable for the candidate.
This is my personal process for interview and although it is not perfect
it is as fair as I can make it right now.

## Can Non-Passionate Developers Have Successful Careers?

Yes. Most developers are not particularly passionate about the craft.
It is a common misconception that in order to be a software developer
you need to spend a lot of time outside of work. This is true in some
cases and it is usually in the early days when you struggle to produce
working code.
However it is by no means a requirement to be up to date on all
the trends and have your own projects.

When you are a developer the things that matters is that you can
deliver code using the tools your company uses. If you manage to learn
all you need on the job then you won't need to push harder unless you
want to.
However if you are struggling to meet expectations or you find it hard
to find a new job due to that you lack knowledge. Well, then you will
need to make up the difference in your spare time most likely.

The people who are truly passionate have a lifestyle that is not for
everyone. These are the people you see on social media and conferences.
Try to remember that for every one of them there is an audience of
people who are not on stage. These people are the norm and most of
the industry is made up of people who develop software as a job but
in their spare time they may have any range of other interests.

## What Are Your Thoughts on Bootcamp Graduates?

It is good for soon to be developers to know that Bootcamp
certificates of completion may not weigh as heavily as
a college degree or similar.

The reason behind it is usually that some companies view
degree's as a more serious education. This prejudice is
luckily not so widespread that it should discourage developers
who feel a Bootcamp is more their style.

At the end of the day what will matter is your skill and
once you have work experience almost no one will care
what degree you have. Degrees are what you use to get
in to the industry and once you are in they lose
most of their meaning.

## What Traits Do the Best Software Developers Have?

I find that they have a genuine interest in their work.
It is that interest that drives them to explore various ways
to solve their problem.

Apart from their interest, they have the ability to pick the
right solution for their problem. This means that their solutions
on average simplify the work.

It is a common misconception that the developers who know the
most tools and can talk at length about trends are the best.
I argue that it is the developers who know how to solve a
problem with the least amount of complexity that are the real
rock-stars of our profession.

## Are You a Senior Developer When Problems No Longer Scare You?

Not at all. Seniority is not determined by how you feel, it
is determined by what you are able to do.
Many senior developers never get fully comfortable with all
the practices and tools of the trade. It is nearly impossible
to be a master of all the things you need to ship software
by current standards.

What determines seniority is a vague definition that is usually
determined one part by what the current trends are and how well
you are able to deliver.

If you have around 4+ years of work experience and you can ship
on time while using the current tools of the trade you will
be considered senior by most employer. It is however important
to understand that the title senior can be defined in many
ways and there is no real true definition.

## What Was Your Best Job Experience as a Software Developer?

I would say that it was when I finally felt that I was good enough.

For a long time I, just as many developers, felt like I could not
measure up to the expectations of my coworkers.
I was never fast enough. I would get anxious when people
added comments on my code. I still remember the panic
I felt the first time I broke production.

Over the years the fear started going away but it was only
when I realized that the trust my coworkers and managers
put in me was at a level where my choices had major impact.
Yet I was not afraid. I remember being scared when I had to
fix a bug and now I could comfortably take on work that
had major impact and have people be happy with the results
without breaking a sweat.

The tasks I faced where much larger and the potential
consequences of getting it wrong were massive but I felt
no fear, no anxiety. It was just another project.

## How to Pick a Tech Project to Advance Your Career?

I always recommend that you start by asking where you are in
your career and what goals you have. The choices a junior should
consider can be different than what a senior may want to consider.

For junior developers looking to break in to the industry and
secure a long term career I recommend that you pick projects
that will give you basic training. By basic training I mean
that you get to work with coworkers as part of a team and you
code on a project that will teach you how to ship products
that are built using the same common tools.
For web development the bread and butter project is a CRUD
application with a user interface that people visit through
a web browser.

This choice is significant because once you start working
your previous roles will impact your future prospects.
If you spend a lot of time in niched tools and project
you may find that the interest people show in your CV
is less than for your peers who have skills more relevant
to the industry at large.

I encourage developers to try things out and experiment.
However, you should remember that if your goal is to get
stable work you need to be able to deliver code with the
tools of the trade. So making sure you have those skills
is a good idea if you ask me. At least before your career
progresses for too long.

The reason you want to be a bit tactical with the projects
early on is that as you gain seniority the more expectations
you will in general have on you. In the early days it is more
acceptable that you need support with basic tools and practices
but as you get more years you will in general be expected to
be more self reliant.

For more experienced developers who have the basics down and
have perhaps had a few jobs it matters less what they choose
since their skills are at a level where they can apply for
most jobs and have a good chance of finding work.
These developers will often benefit more from looking at what
they lack to progress. It may be that they want to move in to
a more management type of role and they then need to get exposure
to the sort of environment that puts them in a leader role.
It may be that they want to try a role where they get to work
with different tools and then getting a working understanding
of those tools is a natural choice. It really depends on what
goals they have.

## What Does It Feel Like to Succeed in a Technical Interview?

This is where I say good, right? Yes, it feels good.

I remember when I passed my first interview for a major company.
I was ecstatic and so excited. I think the feeling is as close as
I will get to having my big dream come true.
After years of study and hundreds of hours just trying to figure
out why I wasn't smart enough to figure out why the code would not
work. I had made it through a nerve wracking interview and been
found worthy. How could I not feel good about this epic achievement.

These feeling lasted for about a week and were quickly replaced with
new anxieties and worries. After all now I had to actually make things
for real and now the main concern wasn't to get the job, it was to
keep it.

These days I look back at how I used to view interviews and I still
feel happy when I get an offer. I still feel nervous, although much
less than before. Though much remains somewhat the same I like to
think that I find them less dramatic.

I used to think that passing or failing was the one thing that
determined my value as a programmer. Today I have done enough
interview to feel that they are a lot less a measurement of
my value and more like a talent competition. How well I do
has one part to do with my own skill but a large part is
down to who the judges are so even if one panel of judges
don't like what I do it doesn't mean that another panel
will judge the same way.

## Why Do Tech Job Titles Often Seem Unclear?

Usually it is a reflection of the company internals and their structure.
What this in practice means is that companies name roles depending
on semantics that make sense to their own corporate structure.
If a company has a need for a role that is common within the
industry at large they will use that name but for more complex
roles they will invent something or borrow names that roughly
fits the bill.

The main thing to know is that a title is a bit like when you
name a function in programming. For a simple function the name
will be easy and make total sense but for a really big function
that does many things the name can almost not be written so well
that it captures the logic in the function.
Titles work the same way in many ways. There is an element of
importance inflation to account for as well. This means that
often titles will sound appealing to promote the importance
and competence of the person doing the job. You will at times
find that someone has amazing skills but have a title that does
not reflect it and of course you will find people with fancy
titles who seem to know next to nothing.

## How Do Career Ladders In IT Companies Work?

Each company does it differently but there is a general template.
Most of the time the company will divide the salary brackets and
roles in to steps on the ladder. How many steps the ladder has
varies and so does the title itself.

A common name convention is Engineer level #  and similar.

Each step has a set of criteria the developer needs to meet
in order to advance. It is common that the manager will require
some form of proof that you are at a certain level so it is good
to remember to highlight things you do that fall in line with
what the criteria is.

Apart from meeting the ladders criteria it is common to have
what is called a 360 degree review. This is most of the time
a chance for coworkers to give feedback on your performance.
Your manager will look at the proof you have provided, which
is usually just verbal examples of what you have done that
meets the criteria, and the 360 degree review feedback to
make an assessment.
Depending on the results you will either advance to a given
level of the ladder or get goals to achieve to advance.

## Why Do Large Companies Hire So Many Developers?

Usually it is because the project stakeholders defer the
practical hiring to engineering managers. These managers
are the ones who are doing the hiring based on how big a
project is and the budget they get for staffing.

Based on their knowledge they will hire and as you can imagine,
for really big companies they have a lot of projects so that
becomes a decent amount of people quickly.
However, it is worth knowing that because it is very difficult
to predict how productive a developer will be or how many people
you will need and of course keeping track of who is doing what
in a large company, it is almost inevitable that large companies
end up with a lot of people who work on similar things without
knowing about each other or building projects that may not be
needed as much as others.
This is one of the main incentives large companies have for
mass layoffs.
This cycle is very common, company grows it staff to handle
new projects, development with varying results happen and
then the company does mass layoffs to balance the budget.
What remains is often the staff that the managers want to
keep and then it starts over again.

## Is Developer Compensation Proportional To Productivity?

No, compensation is usually based on more complex factors.

Compensation is impacted by many things but a few main ones are:

- Where you work
- For who
- As what
- With what
- How good you are at negotiating
- How long you have been working

Just as the riches people in the world are not always the
people who work the hardest or are the most gifted. So is your
compensation is not necessarily tied to how good your code is.
