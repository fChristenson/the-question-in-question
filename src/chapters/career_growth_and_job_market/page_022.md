## What Was Your First Job In Software Development Like?

Terrible. Some of the toughest times in my life hands down. I woke
up dreading to go to work on some days and others it was merely a
bit of anxiety that hit me. At the time I was brought in to a firm
that had an idea to developer a salary management system. The idea
was simple, take what was a desktop application and make it a
web application. The company was able to provide me some minor support
by asking one of the original developers of the web application to
assist me when he had time to spare away from his own project.
This turned out to be too little for my needs at the time and as you
can imagine, it did not get better. In the last months of my stay I
was joined by two other partners. These where two university students
who had managed to create a startup with a lot of overlap with the
system I was working on. They joined forces with the firm and I now
had a business developer and another software developer to work with.
Sadly the situation did not improve. In my last months with the
company I got notice that they felt I did not meet expectation.
This came as no surprise to me but I still felt the hit to my confidence.
Being the shaky leaf of insecurities that I am, I was crushed.

Luckily I had been contacted by another company at around the same
time. I took an interview, got an offer and moved on.
At the time it felt like a failure but in hindsight it was one of
the best changes I have made in my career.

## How Can Hiring Managers Effectively Evaluate Cvs And Determine Seniority?

I suggest you acknowledge if you have the tech background to evaluate
developers or not. This is a bit of an honest moment for some since
we need to accept that although being a manager has many challenges
that grow skills that are important to an organization, this is an
area managers usually don't spend a lot of time in.
It is by far better to collaborate with people who have done the work
for many years so the assessment becomes as accurate as it can be.

The main challenge a manager will face in this scenario is biases
from the developers. If you have inexperienced developers or perhaps
highly opinionated developers, you may find that screening people
becomes a struggle. Poor social skills in the developers can create
further challenges when it comes time to do a personal interview
and worse, you may end up with a team that is incapable of delivering
anything or handle basic communication with stakeholders.

So, what to do? I can recommend that you start by asking yourself
if you have any developers with well developed social skills in
the company. Seniority is of less importance at this stage since
you first want to make sure you have people who have the needed
social skills to handle the interview process. Once you know that
you have people who understand how to communicate well and who
understand the importance of having someone who fits in the company,
you can take the next step.

The next step is to list down the technology tools you use for the
project your are hiring for. Focus on the main tool names that you
usually see on peoples CV's or in job postings from other companies.
This is important since this gives you a checklist of tools a new
candidate should have. Then discuss with the developers you have
brought in to collaborate with. Focus on aligning on determining
what tools are most important so you can put emphasis on the tools
that are most important to your project.

Lastly, I give this advice. Focus on getting a developer who is  good
social fit and knows the main tools. It is really hard for someone
who is a layman in tech to figure out just how good someone is and
more often than not you will end up hiring people who on paper are
good but for some reason you find further down the line that the
project is facing issues. If you hire people who know the tools
and have strong communication skills you, at the very least, have
a good chance to fix things with communication.

## What Is Within The Scope Of A Software Engineer After 10 Years?

Potentially everything. The best way I can describe the scope change
for a developer over the years is that the longer you do the job the
higher the expectations go. Don't fret, there is a limit to what people
will expect from you but there is a catch worth knowing about.

The catch is that each company is different. This is the greatest challenge
facing companies when staffing their projects, in my view. You always
need good people but what's worse is that you need people who can handle
your specific stack. For us developers this makes life a lot harder.
Due to the diversity of the stacks on the market we my very well need
to know a significant amount of workflows to confidently be able to
apply for work. I am sure that more than a few people have reflected
on how diverse and lengthy the profiles companies request job applicants
to have can be. This is the fallout of having a large ecosystem of
choices.

I think it is safe to say that the pattern is usually this.
At a junior level you are mostly responsible for knowing the
basics of your stack. Usually you will mostly be focusing on
just getting your deliverables in to production. Once you have
done that for a few years people will expect you to be able to
do an increasing amount of tasks independently. How much more
depends on the company. In some teams there is very little
other than the coding you need to take care of but in others
you may find yourself doing a range of things other than the coding.

The most common things that creep in to your scope are basic DevOps
tasks. These are usually things such as checking system health, logs,
deployments and so on. The best way I can summarize it is, you need
to know the practical tasks that include deploying, running and
debugging your system.
