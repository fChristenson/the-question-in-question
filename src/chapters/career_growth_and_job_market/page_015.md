## How To Deal With Engineers Seeking Promotions Too Soon?

I would say that you should ask, why do you feel it is too soon?

I argue that promotion should be based on the needs of the company
and if the developer has the needed profile to fill the role.
This is how hiring works but for some reason many seem to view
promotion different from hiring. There is this idea that you should
have proof that you have done the job you are asking to get promoted
to, which is utter nonsense if you ask me. If you hire someone to do
a job then you can expect them to do that job but if you expect them
to prove to you that they can do another job before you promote them,
you will need to be lucky enough to have a job that allows that to
happen. If you are never provided the opportunity to do work that is
relevant for the role you want, then you will never be able to progress.

When evaluating someone for a promotion, simply ask if there is enough
to go on in order to feel confident in that this person can handle
the work. If there is not, provide the developer with a set of activities
that will give them a chance to prove their abilities. This is a reasonable
thing to ask, I would argue and it will show if the request for promotion
is too early or not.

## What Does It Feel Like To Succeed In A Technical Interview?

Pretty good, I must say. It took me a few years to understand
something that changed my way of looking at interviews but even
today it feels nice to succeed.

The main thing that changed my way of looking at interviews was
that I noticed how subjective the hiring process is and even what
many consider to be good code. I had lengthy arguments with people
about what the correct way of doing something was in one company
and in another the answer was considered so obvious that we never
discussed it. When I understood that getting accepted is one part
knowing your tools but also one part the values of the person doing
the interview, my viewpoint changed. I started to look at interviews
as something closer to a talent show than some objective assessment
of my skills as a software developer. Who wins a talent show is to
some extent based on their talent but also what the judges and producers
think.

When I let myself feel a bit more confident in my abilities, mainly
due to that I know for a fact that I have shipped hundreds of features
some who have even worked, I started to take interviews a bit less
seriously. The feeling was similar to how I felt when I stopped thinking
that getting a comment on my code in a pull request was a personal
attack on me. At some point you understand that it is nearly impossible
to always win and the main thing to consider is if you do well on average.
When you know that most of the time you do well enough the impact of
the outcomes affect you less. At least for me.

## Why Do Development Teams Love Agile?

I would not go as far as to say all of us love it.
To my mind it is a topic of debate and will probably never be
a settled matter. Agile, just as any other process has it's time
in the spotlight and I am sure that whatever comes after will be
just as debated as Agile is today.

The key elements that makes any project successful has, in my
view, very little to do with a work framework and more to do
with an equal part of good team rituals and good teamwork.
These concepts are not unique to Agile and most development
teams usually find a way to do work regardless of what work
framework they use. Since the topic of Agile vs other approaches
is still under debate, I feel it is safe to say that Agile so
far has not been proven to provide any definitive benefit that
you can't get by other means.

I see more teams go through the motions of Agile than I see
truly effective processes and in my view, that is due to the
inherit problem with a mental framework someone else made up
for you. Copy pasting a solution someone else has shown you
is in my view less effective than taking the time to understand
how you can make sure that the practical matters you need in place
during your work are there when they need to be. I suggest that
what development teams love is not Agile but rather rituals and
team norms that make sense to them. So far no one I have worked
with feels that all things Agile is a good idea and so I simply
suggest that you pick what works and leave the rest.

I can't really speak for others but I suspect the positive feedback
people get is similar to how people struggling with being overweight.
When people who mean well, see someone taking a risk to improve their
life, the natural response for many is to praise them. After all they
are taking charge of their life and going out fixing something.
The praise is intended to make you feel good, not think rationally.
There is no harm done here since we should in my view separate the
two. You can praise someone for doing something to improve and you
can tell them if what they are trying is realistic without one
harming the other. It is a fine balance naturally, since some people
would prefer to feel good rather than be realistic. Though it is
worth knowing that pessimistic views can often be disguised as
realistic thinking.

Ageism is not something exclusive to IT. It is also not much
different from other prejudices various groups face in the market.
I find that the real determining factor for if a candidates age has
any meaningful impact is not the number of years they have lived but
rather what type of person they have become during those years.
I have seen people of a distinguished age get work in everything
that the fresh graduates get. I can't recall any interview I have been
to where the topic of the candidates age came in to question.

As you can imagine, my experiences are by no means an absolute truth
when we discuss the subject of ageism. I am certain that there are
people who wrinkle their noses in disgust at CV's where the candidate
has one too many wrinkles on their face. I like to imagine that as
they do they carefully check that there is no bald spot emerging nor
any crowfeet peaking out from under their makeup.

If you are subjected to these sorts of people my best advice is to
do what we all do. Try again with another company. If you have the
skills and you have a lovable personality with a spare smile for
the people you greet in the interview, most rational people will
seriously consider you for the position.
