## Are Biases An Issue In Software Recruitment?

Oh dear God, yes. There is not a single interviewer
who doesn't inject their own ideas of what a "good"
software developer is, nor could we expect anything
less, if you ask me. I would even go as far as to say
that it is a given that we color candidates in the
shade of our ideas when we speak to people. Luckily
enough, this does not have to be an issue if we are
smart about it. We can after all use a bit of personal
reflection and be honest about what we should be on the
lookout for when we make assessments of a candidates
abilities.

As a rule, I try to have at least 2 people doing the
interview. This is by no means a foolproof way to
remove biases from the equation but it does mitigate
them a bit. The tricky part after is to discuss the
viewpoints of each interviewer without the social
game shifting peoples opinions. The social game in
this context is in my view how the dynamics of the
group shift based on their relationship with each
other. If you have people who share the same values
they will often reach a unified opinion about the
candidate. However, if that group have a strong bias
you will find that they staff your company with people
who are just like them. This can be great if they are
paragons of whatever you want in your teams but if
they are small friction machines who cause all manner
of issues, you will get more people who solidify that
behavior in the company. They may not hire people like
them but they will hire people who allow them to keep
their ways of working.

If you have interviewers with a strong influence over
the others, I suggest you add someone to the discussion
of hiring the candidate who can act as a bit of a social
buffer. Usually people with strong opinions will trample
those who prefer to go with the flow and in such cases
you are best of by adding someone who ensures that each
person can express their ideas and helps them by asking
them why they feel how they feel about the candidate.
This is often enough to deal with major biases.

The most important lesson I have learned about biases
in interviews is to ask myself, "can this person do the
job I am asking them to do?". This was something I did
not understand until later in my career but it changed
my way of looking at the craft. As a die hard programming
fanatic, I of course had a lot of ideas about what good
code was and what good programmers looked like. It was
only later that I started to understand that if I
expected each and every candidate to be a open source
maintainer with their own string of tech talks, I would
never hire anyone. Funnily enough, I never reflected on
that the coworkers I already had where perfectly capable
of shipping working code to production without all these
merits that I felt were proof of skill.
It then dawned on me that perhaps I have forgotten the
main question when hiring someone for a job. After all,
if we look at sports for example. There are many people
who play sports at different levels and we may look to
the top league players when we think about what good
players look like. However, we all know that even if
they may be the ideal, we can still have a lot of fun
at the lower levels. The same is true for working.
There are products that require people of top level
talent to make but on average you simply need someone
who is good enough to do the job. Our society would
not function if each and every position could only
be filled by someone we perceive as a top level
performer.

When I understood that my bias was to only hire people
who where as extreme about their passion for programming,
I shifted my way of thinking to trying to figure out where
the passing grade was. Instead of trying to figure out if
the candidate was a top performer, I simply asked myself
what they need to fit in without issue. I found that so
far this strategy helped me a lot in hiring some great
people. The code is getting shipped and it mostly works,
so the true goal of hiring someone has been accomplished.
