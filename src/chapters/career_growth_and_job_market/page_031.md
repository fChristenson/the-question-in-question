## What Are The Biggest Reasons Developers Leave Jobs?

The most common reasons are not as exciting as you may think.
Well, at least not in my experience.

Usually developers leave work for personal reasons, such as
relocating with family or similar. The second most common is
that they got a better offer from some other company. It is
not that often I see developers leaving a job just because
some other company offers them work but rather because they
have felt that they needed a change for a time and for whatever
reason, the company could not satisfy this need for them.

People outside the big club we call IT, imagine that developers
quit over bad code but in reality that is not the case.
Usually, developer complain about bad code but few feel so
strongly about it that they will risk their stable job over
something like that. In a way it is similar to people who learn
to adapt to poor working conditions in any job, from the outside
it seems odd but if you factor in job prospects and other similar
insecurities people in that job have, it starts to make more sense.

## How Can Developers Recognize When Itâ€™s Time To Move On?

It depends on your goals, as per usual.

My personal mantra is to always ask myself "is my job getting
me closer to my next goal"? It is that simple for me at least.

The reason I ask this question is because of a phenomenon that
is very human. It is the process of adjusting to things over
time. This is how you get spoiled kids who throw tantrums over
not getting their way, because their parents have conditioned
them to an environment where that is what they expect.
This is also how people can adjust to living in horrible conditions
that for the majority would be nightmarish. People can learn to
be ok with a lot.

For me this means that I have to commit myself to keeping my options
open. People who stay forever in the same job regardless if they
like it or hate it often have no other option or lack the will
to move on. This is how stagnation creeps in.

Stagnation is not the worst thing in the world and it happens to
everyone to some degree. It only becomes dangerous when it start
to affect your market value. As a developer your market value is
based on your ability to meet the current markets demand for coding
and that means knowing how to work in the stack used by the companies
you want to work for. If you are not able to keep a working understanding
of current tools and practices, you should consider moving on.

Safeguarding your long term career depends a lot on your ability to
understand at what phases of your career you will be and what will
be important to know at that point. This is why I always do a personal
reflection of what value I am adding to my CV with my current job on
a regular basis. A simple calendar reminder is enough for me to stop
and ponder if I have any better options to improve my market value
or improve my skills than what I have right now.

## What Should Developers Focus On When Starting A New Job?

Start by having your own personal workstation setup that you feel
really comfortable using. This is very important since if you feel
insecure in the tools you use to write code it will slow you down
and it will impact your mood. Think about your choices in editors
and other tools as a musician and their instrument. It is your most
important tool for your job so make sure you know it well.

Once you have a setup that you know well and allows you to write code
the way you feel comfortable, get the source code on your workstation
and get a local version of the system working. The quicker you can
get this setup the better because now you can start trying out the
system and see how it works without any risk.

Next, find out who knows the most about what. Regardless if you are
a junior or a senior, you won't know how things work in this new
company without a bit of guidance. In every company there is almost
always a few people who know a lot about various areas of the system
and the workflows. These we sometimes refer to as domain experts.
Find them, be nice to them and make sure you have easy access to them.
They will be very important to you until you learn enough about the
system so you can manage on your own.

## How Can Developers Maintain A Long-term Career In Tech?

Understand what skills you need at any one point in time and
position yourself to always be learning what you need for one
of two important things.

Number one, market value. This is by far the most important observation
any craftsman can make. Know the market you work in and what people
are paying for. Your choices in tools and framework should ideally
be somewhat aligned with the market. It is fine to deviate, after all,
IT is large and diverse. However, make sure that you understand that
learning a cool library or picking up a obscure programming language
may be fun and teach you new things, but it will likely not be a
strong selling point when it comes time to send in your CV.

Second, understand your career phases and what matters most in
each phase. As a junior, your focus should be to learn the coding so
you can ship code with as little assistance as possible. This is how
you get to be a mid level developer, where the sweet-spot is for most
professional programmers. During this phase you focus should be to
mature your understanding of how to build systems of various kinds.
What type of surrounding services and tools are common. Things like
different type of cloud providers, databases, practices and so on
will benefit you a lot when it comes time to step in to the promised
land of seniors.

Well, congrats. You made it. Now you are a senior. This is where it
gets tricky to predict what will benefit you because it will be down
to how the market shifts and what your own goals are. As a general
rule, it is worth making sure you master how to get software from an
idea phase, to planning out backlog items and all the way to production.
This flow is always the most important in all companies you will work
in and it will be invaluable to understand even if you want to move
in to leadership in the future.
