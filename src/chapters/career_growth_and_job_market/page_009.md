## How can you provide constructive feedback to developers?

I usually handle this in two different ways and the method
differs slightly depending on if I am a fellow developer in
the team or if I am in a position of authority such as being
the Tech lead or similar. The reason is because depending
on my role the requirements on my work and the expectations
I can put on my coworkers makes most people perceive my
feedback differently.

Most commonly I simply provide my feedback as a alternative
option and I highlight what it is about my suggestion that
makes me like it and what I may not like about it.
I try to avoid focusing too much on what is wrong about the
approach my coworker is taking until I see that the discussion
is stretching out due to that we view things differently and feel
somewhat equally deep about the subject.

The key element here is that when I am a fellow software developer
I don't want to attempt to force my coworker to do things my way.
I want the subject to be approved collectively. The reason for this
is that if I take an opposing view to my coworker and we can't see
eye to eye we can quickly cause tension between us. This is not
the case if I can see that we can't agree and I simply suggest
we raise it with a third party and vote on the subject or take
the view of whoever is in a position of more authority. This
may seem counterintuitive to us who are engineers and are taught
that there is a right way to make things but what I like to point
out is that there is more than one way to do most things and even
if you know of a superior way that won't matter much if the other
developers can't see the value and follow your train of thought.
What is even worse is that you may find yourself being fired in
an extreme case over the very changes you try to force people in
to and then what was the point? Consider that all it takes for your
ideas to fall apart is that someone who feels like you do comes
after and simply undoes your work. Again, what is the point of
forcing people to do things your way if it does not benefit you?

The key observation here is that your best move is almost always
to propose a viewpoint and see if the idea gains traction or at
the very least people are willing to hear you out. If there is no
headway made with this approach proceed with caution and really think
about if your view is so important that whatever benefits you gain
from getting your way are worth the potential consequences.

This is my guiding principles when I provide feedback to a developer.
As a rule I simply suggest, make my case on why I suggest what I do
and then we decide as a group what seems to be the best approach.
The only time I change this pattern is if I have an obligation due
to my role that forces me to take a stance on something the team may
oppose. A trivial example is testing. If I work as the Tech lead and
our teams stakeholders have an issue with quality, then I explain
to my team that writing tests is expected and not a subject for debate.
How we write them and what we use to do so we can debate but doing
it is a expectation.
I take this stance because at times you may need to provide feedback
that is not welcome and as mentioned previously, you may need to
encourage a change but without authority you can't force someone
to do things how you want without good reason.

## What Should You Know Before Starting Your Own IT Company?

I have found that the main things are:

- Do you have a paying customer
- Do you know how to expectations

It is important that you understand that making money from software
has a few natural phases.
The first phase is the proof of concept. This is where you need to
understand who will use your software and how you will make money
from it. Most companies struggle to become profitable and a project
that won't make any money until it is already several years in to
it's growth is going to make it though to survive while you are
building it. Make sure you don't underestimate how important it
is to not only be excited about making great software but also
about finding people willing to pay for the work you do.

The next thing to think about is that you need to be able to
deliver on expectations. A flaw that a lot of engineers have
is the idea of quality and how important it is. It is one of
the rare occasions where I advocate for taking a page from
the entrepreneurs of the world and stop being overly concerned
with how well your code is made and rather be concerned with if
your customers are happy with the results.
Software developers often forget that their company will be able
to improve the quality of it's code as long as they are willing
to invest time and money in it but if you have no money you
will not. Never forget that some of the most successful companies
are not necessarily the companies behind the most state of the art
software.

The second phase is when you start to grow. This is when you need
to be mindful that you grow at a pace that you can sustain.
As you hire more people you need to keep a focus on where the
money comes from and do what you can to ensure that the people
you gather to help your business grow are increasing the cashflow.
It is common that as your company grows you get various perspectives
on how you should run things. However you want to run your company
is up to you and your peers but remember to always keep an eye on
what is paying the bills and how the choices you make impact that
because no matter how you slice it the others who are part of your
companies journey may leave if they don't get their way but they
will also leave if you don't pay them.
