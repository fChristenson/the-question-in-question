## How To Deal With Impostor Syndrome In Software Development?

Probably the most common insecurity of any developer is the feeling
of not being as good as you need to be.
To this day I am not completely rid of the feeling of anxiety
that comes from not being able to meet expectations.
It has changed from being about my level of coding to being more
about my ability to interact without stakeholders without friction
but it is still the same sensation.

Luckily I managed to put most of my fears related to my level of
coding skill to rest. The trick was simple, be good at what you do.
Now that may sounds obvious but let me explain. I hope we both can
agree that a term I like is applicable to your skills as a software
developer. That term is "reasonable expectations". Why is this
important? It is important because when you feel like you are not good
enough, I argue that the first thing to ask is if you are meeting
reasonable expectations given your situation. We can almost always
be better than we are but when you are doing work what matters is
if your results stand in proportion to the role you have.

Once I started thinking less about how much worse I am at my job
than the true masters of software development and I started to thinking
about how good my results are in comparison with others at my level,
a big portion of my fears vanished.
I will not go as far as to say that this will remove all your fear.
After all each of us feel things in our own way and you may want to
consider medical help if you find yourself crippled by your anxiety.
However, I would like to think that the best medicine for impostor
syndrome is to work hard at your craft until you know that you can
meet the expectations of the projects you work on.

Remember, you can always be better but it is important to look
at where you are right now. You need stop a little bit and reflect
on if you are good enough for your level or not. Regardless of how
you feel your best bet is to accept that the fear of not being good
enough will always be there and the way forward is to understand what
productive actions you can take to feel more confident. When you Practices
this approach you will hopefully understand that just as how you
are now no longer afraid of some things you used to be afraid of,
you can view the impostor syndrome the same way. It is a fear that
is cured best by improving yourself until you feel that you can do
what you are afraid of well enough for it to no longer be an
obstacle for you.

## How To Pass The Trial Period At A New Job?

For those of you who work in regions where this is not a custom.
Trial periods is a period of time in the start of your employment
where the company have certain legal rights they will lose once
it is over. Usually this is related to how easy it is to terminate
the employment but it can differ.

My viewpoint is mostly the same regardless if you are in the start
of the employment or far in to it. I suggest the following:

- Raise your positive attitude by 40%
- Suggest rather than being strongly opinionated
- Treat your coworkers as a clerk in a shop would

The way I summarize this is to adopt a persona that suits your
personality. Many people in popular work culture advocates for
letting your hair down and being yourself. I argue that only
people who are the right version of whatever their boss and
coworkers define as pleasant can afford that luxury.
For the rest of us it is better to remember that there are always
conditions for how well you do in any situation. At work your
best option is usually to remember that the quality of your work
is not the only thing that matters. How people feel about your
matters in equal measure so if you are not fortunate enough to
love everyone and have everyone love you back you can at least
remind yourself that to some extent you will need to fit in.

My persona is derived from the Shrek character Donkey. I know
that smiling and trying to be someone who encourages my ideas
without becoming unpleasant when I am not being taken seriously
is a way of behaving that is a sweet-spot between how I am in
private and what my coworkers find to be someone they can accept.

## Is It Okay To Take A Break From Studying Software Development?

Naturally, studying too much has a negative effect on knowledge
retention and study without retention seems ineffective to me.

There is a common myth in software development. The myth about
the software developer who does nothing but code. What is worse
is that some in the community seem to believe that this is what
is considered a prerequisite for finding work.

There are companies who have hiring policies that may seem like
the lifestyle of those developer who spend their free time working
on open source projects or are active in other areas of the community.
However, it is important to take note of something if you ask me.
When you watch tech talks, count how many people are in the audience
and how many speakers there is on stage. It is easy to forget that
most of the people who work as software developer are just regular
people doing a job.

I believe that we should give thanks to those in the community
with the drive to go above and beyond what is required to do
good work in our respective companies but it would be a great
disservice to them and to the rest of us if we started treating
their efforts as the norm.
