## What Interesting Problems Do You Solve Daily As A Developer?

I am not sure it meets the criteria of interesting but I would
say, streamlining. Every single day I sit for hours and try to
understand how I can cut wasted time from all kinds of areas.
I like to express what programmers do as, trying to take a
process and convert it to a virtual version of itself. Once
that is done, we spend all our time trying to figure out how
we can make this process as effective as possible. It is in
a way how I imagine mathematicians feel when they break down
something in to equations. Once that is done, they can start
trying to figure out all kinds of improvements or answer
questions related to the domain they are working in.

Being a programmer has an effect on your way of thinking.
After a while you start to care about naming things well,
even outside your code. For some reason you spend time trying
to figure out the best way to make everyday tasks streamlined.
More than once, I have found myself feeling joy when I figured
out a better way to store my things so they don't get in the
way when I clean. I can be high on that for hours.

Most of the time, I find that the job shapes my mind to work
with abstract concepts very well. I often see programmers
forget that not everyone around them has their way of thinking.
To us it feel natural to break down large problems in to smaller
ones and then order them in cadence of dependencies. This way of
thinking serves us well in our work and outside of it, if you
ask me at least. I advice all developers to think about how you
tackle problems in code even outside of your work, there are a
lot of benefits of that way of thinking in everyday life and
you will be surprised how often people around you will appreciate
your input.

## How To Identify If A Developer Is Overqualified For A Team?

I look at two things when I pick a developer for a team.
First, what type of system is the team working on. This is
of paramount importance and the most underestimated factor
managers overlook. Systems may all use code but the level
of complexity and the dynamics of the development process
can vary vastly. If this is not accounted for you easily
end up putting a junior on a senior level project or you
hire a senior who need a lot of direction for a project
that requires them to just go with their gut and do things
based on their own judgement.

Once I know what type of system I am hiring for, I can look
at the developers skill level and their personality.
I argue to my managers that for an average project, it is
a waste to put a top notch developer. They are so rare that
unless the project is in dire need of top notch skills, it
is better to place them on something high stakes or put them
in a product development team support role. Think staff engineer
or similar roles.

So how do we know if they are overqualified? Simple, talk
to them. In an interview you will quickly see what their
technical depth is and how they manage their self learning,
if you ask the right questions. Combine this experience with
your knowledge of the projects needs and you will get a good
feeling for their fit for the team.

The second thing to consider is the social dynamics of the team.
If you underestimate this you will end up with a lot of frustration
and problems in the team. Start by considering the current team
and the types of personalities you are dealing with. Two classic
mismatches is when you have a team of average developers who for
the most part are fine with keeping a good enough quality level
and then you put in a high energy, ambitious and strongly opinionated
developer. Trouble is just a matter of time. The frustration usually
comes from that the new developer feels frustration over the lack of
enthusiasm from their peers and the peers find their sticking their
nose in everyone's business, irritating.

The other case is when the roles are reversed and you put a mellow
type of developer, who prefers to work in a team where there are
processes in place that let them focus on their area without having
to take on a lot of extra responsibilities, in a team with highly
social developers. More than once, I have heard about cases where
the team wants to mob code all the time and feeling disheartened
that some team mates really don't want to work that way. Who is
to say what is right, but I hope we can agree that it is hard to
create a productive work environment when the team members are
too far apart in how they want to do work.

By knowing the project and the team you can usually figure out
what impact a new candidate will have.

## Why Do Most Programming Jobs Require Tool Knowledge?

Because you won't produce any value without them. Programming
has no value unless the code can be used by an end user. To
make that happen you will need tools outside of the programming
language you pick to write your program in.

In most larger development projects, it is common practice to
at the very least have some type of delivery pipeline and a
hosting solution for your code. Apart from these you will
most of the time find that cloud services and Agile workflow
tools are used. There is simply no way for you to avoid learning
these if you want to be part of a serious software team today.

The good news is that for the most part, you won't need to know
every little detail about these tools. The main thing is to know
how to be effective at everyday tasks.

We can also expand our scope of what we consider tools. Is Git
a tool? Well yes, it is. As you can imagine you will need to know
it in order to save your changes and do updates to the main codebase.
If you don't know how to do that, it won't matter much if you can write
code, since it will never create any value for anyone.

The best mindset you can have, if you ask me, is to think in terms
of value provided. You need to learn the tools and processes
involved in producing value for users. Without that, your coding skills
don't earn money and you won't get paid. Some parts of the delivery
process you may not need to know because it is someone elses job to
do it for you but the bottom line is still the same. We do what we
do to create value. What we need to know in order to do that changes
over time and can differ from project to project.
