## Are The First Years Of A Developerâ€™s Career The Most Transformative?

Yes, they have a lot of impact on your growth.

Since experience is what most companies care about your first few years
will matter a lot since you won't have a big range of tools you have
work experience with. This means that when it is time to switch job
the meat of your CV is found in what you have done in previous roles.
This is true for senior developers as well and it can quickly become
a pattern in your career. You have worked with something and so you
look for that again since it is the most valuable thing you have to
offer.

This is why I argue that it is important to get experience working
in an environment that will be similar regardless of what company
you decide to work for. Companies often favour hiring people who
have experience with similar tools and practices to their own
and although it is fine to not have exactly the same profile
as what is asked, it does impact your market value.

The key insight that you should have about yourself is that as
the years pass you will likely change as a person. When you
start out you may feel excited and eager to learn but will
you feel that way after 10 years? It is hard to say but
what is of paramount importance to understand is that no
one cares if you have worked for 20 years if you can't
meet their expectations. As a junior developer your main
problem is usually to get someone to give you a chance.
However, seniors face a similar issue. Seniors who lack
the experiences that are in demand will struggle and
now they find themselves with a choice. Learn what they
lack or keep looking for jobs where their experience
is more relevant.

From what I have seen, most senior developers peak after
5 years of working. This is why I urge developers to know
yourself well enough to have a plan for how you will keep
your skills relevant over time. Even if you learn the most
in your first 5 years you should still not forget that just
because you may grow tired of learning doesn't mean that the
IT industry stops changing. You don't have to go crazy and
feel stress over falling behind, just have a plan and keep
an eye out for what people are using in the industry.

## Does Switching Programming Jobs Get Easier Over Time?

It depends on what your CV looks like. If you fill it with
work that is similar and relevant to other roles then yes.
However, if you do work that doesn't grow your skills in
the areas that are in demand it can become harder over time.
The reason being that as you gain seniority the expectations
on you also grows. If you have worked for many years but those
years haven't gained you experiences that people want to pay for,
then it won't matter how long you have worked.

Seniority is just an indicator of skill and as you can imagine,
if you have a mismatch between how good you are at your job
and how long you have been doing it, people will notice.
It is a bit like growing up. If you act your age you are meeting
peoples expectations of someone your age but if you act like a
an immature child peoples impression of you will get worse the
older you get.

The good part is that most companies have similar way of working
and many programming languages are very similar. It usually takes
the longest to learn your first stack and it gets easier to more
you learn. If you take your education seriously and invest in
yourself you will find that almost all companies will be happy
to have you even if you don't know exactly their stack. For
very senior developers it takes a matter of weeks to pick a
new stack and that is good enough for most jobs.

## How Can Developers Build The Confidence To Make A Career Move?

I have always found that confidence comes from the knowledge
that you can handle a situation. If you think back to your
early days I suspect that you can recall things that were
scary at the time but today are not. I argue that the same
is true for things that scare you today to a great extent.

My greatest tip to building confidence is to know your industry
and know what gives you market value. This knowledge is key
in order to create a plan for how you are to stay relevant
during your career and it is equally important when you want
to switch career.

In a way you can think of yourself as a craftsman who gets by
on selling your skills to a customer. So logically if you have
those skills and you feel confident in them, you have market value.
However, if you want to switch to a new role the journey there is
very similar to how it was when you started out but with one major
difference.

That major difference is that now you have some knowledge that may
or may not be relevant to your new role and that is a benefit but
it can also become an excuse. Big changes are to some of us
so intimidating that we would rather stay with something we know
over facing something new and uncertain. This struggle is made easy
when we have no choice and have to take a leap of faith but if we
have options the push our survival instincts give us is not
necessarily going to push us to something new but may stop us
from taking a risk.

Remember that switching careers is not much different from getting
your first job. Do your research and adopt the skills you lack.
Practice and connect with job prospects. With some luck your
previous experience will be to your benefit. Above all remember
that the key is to be prepared for change so be on the lookout
for how the industry moves and adapt accordingly.
