## Should You Consider Scalability For Resume Projects?

No, not at all. Most developers overestimate how much their pet
projects matter to the companies they apply to. If they work with
end customers I can basically promise you that the average customer
will care more about how nice the UI looks than if it runs on a
scalable stack.

The average recruiter won't know what scalability is and frankly, most
don't have the time or skills to deep dive in to a candidates personal
projects. Most people struggle to read the details in a meeting invite,
so I can say with a fair amount of certainty that you won't see them
dive in to the details of your project. There are of course people
who do but it is not the norm.

I advice developer to treat their resume projects as a shop owner treats
their shop window. The key to hooking a customer is to put a nice sign
up and put eye catching items in the window. Treat your projects the
same way. Front the appeal of the project and don't overestimate how
much technical details matter. Most recruiters will be swayed more
by how the project looks and what the main tools are than if you
wrote unit tests or if you have checked the security posture.

## Is Long-term Job Satisfaction In Software Tied To Personal Development?

That is a tricky question. For me, absolutely. However, we should
consider that, although personal growth is at large a human desire,
it may not always be the most important factor in a professional
environment. I have on many occasions had conversations with
developers who felt that their peers did not show enthusiasm
for their ideas about better ways of doing work or new tech to use.
I explained to them that although they may be right about how much
better things would get if the peers changed their ideas of how
to work, it is perhaps not something they are interested in.
For people who are truly engaged and want to work at the bleeding
edge, this seems to be pure blasphemy but let me try to play
devils advocate.

I am sure that if you think about it, you have several things
that you could improve in your daily job. You could probably
spend more time at the gym or read more books or buy better
items for your home. If we follow this idea to it's end you
will at some point, I hope, agree that although this is true,
you are simply not interested in owning the best version of
everything or working out so much that you can compete at a
professional level and so on. In other words, you have a limit
of how much energy you are willing to spend on an area of your
life. Your coworkers are doing exactly the same thing.

You may find the work you do to be something that your team
should pour the most amount of energy in to so that you can
be "the best" at it but for most people it is just a job.
It is a means to make a living. Their energy is likely being
spent on other things than trying to grow as a developer.
Right or wrong, I think we can agree that the average worker
is not trying to be the best at their job, they are simply trying
as hard as they feel is appropriate to live comfortably.

This can be a tough pill to swallow for the achievers of the world.
You may find that you want to push things to be better but the
people around you don't really care about the work as much as you.
This doesn't mean that they don't grow as people. It just means that
they are putting their energy somewhere else. You may wish that they
would put it in to their work but it will save you a lot of frustration
if you can determine if there is a chance for that to happen or if
you should look to spend more time with people who do put a lot of
energy in to growing within the work they do.

## What Happens To Developers In Big It Companies As They Age?

This varies a lot but on average they go in to management or
similar administrative work. There is of course a breed who
stick to their coding until they retire but based on my experience
the average age of the developers range from people in their 20's
to their late 40's whereas the age of people working in management,
especially the higher levels, have a range of 40's and above.

There are plenty of exceptions to these age ranges so take what I
am sharing for what it is, a personal observation from someone who
has been in the industry for a few years.

## How Can It Companies Help New Developers With Onboarding?

I usually suggest that company policy is for the tech lead to
be responsible for making a onboarding guide that is documented
and kept up to date. The goal of the guide is to get the developer
up and running with their local development environment and give
them access to all the systems they need to do their work.

Apart from getting things up and running, I recommend that the
team pick out a few basic stories that will help the developer
learn how the delivery process works. These stories can be tiny
bugfixes or anything really that is possible to do in less than
a day. The goal is to put them on something small so they can
ship something and through doing that, understand how the team
does code reviews, testing and deployments.

I suggest you have a few smaller stories ready and then ease the
developer in to large scope work depending on their progress.

Lastly, make sure that the developers in the team understand that
at least one of them has to reserve time to answer question and
in some cases do pair programming. This needs to be communicated
to them and to the stakeholders so the developer can reserve the
time without fear of falling behind on their own work.

## Is It A Zero-sum Game For Tech Leads To Praise Their Teams?

I am not sure how to answer this. My way of giving praise has
mostly been about noticing growth in the people I work with.
I make a note of when someone shows progress or is able to
execute a task that was either helpful to the team or was
outside of what they knew how to do before. In other words,
praise comes with growth, when you are getting it from me.

I don't praise people on a regular basis as I prefer to keep
it genuine and focused on building pride in the work we do.
If the developers in my team show engagement and try to help
me ensure that the team meets the expectations put on us,
they shower in praise and all of it comes straight from the
heart. I don't care if it is a junior learning how to write
code so there are no mistakes or a senior who handled an
adhoc request when they usually never offer to help, if you
show that you care about helping the team deliver better
results, I will praise it.

Conversely, if you show none of this, you will never hear
a compliment come out of my mouth. Maybe, if you have a
really nice sweater on.

## How To Spot Areas Of Improvement In A Developer?

First, I suggest you start by asking, is this an area they can improve
in or just a different way from how I want it to be done? I argue that
it is vital that you understand that difference. It is easy to fool
yourself in to thinking that what you believe to be constructive feedback
is being ignored because the person in question isn't good at their
job but in reality it is due to a difference in opinion of how to do
something. It is hard to, but try your best to suggest improvements
on things that you can get a majority consensus on within the team
and steer clear of being too picky about minor things until you
know that people are able to see your point.

Once you know how to present your suggestions to the developer,
look at the delivery process. I argue that the main sign of true
mastership of the craft is end to end understanding of the steps
taken to deliver a system the some under customer.
This means that if you know that the developer lacks knowledge
in some area of the delivery process, it is a perfect thing to
suggest that they improve in. A common case is that developers
know how to write code but lack the knowledge to configure
automated pipelines or deployments. This is a very important
part of the end to end understanding I spoke about, so it makes
sense to make it a priority that the developer at least has a
working understanding of how it works and the confidence to take
on tasks related to it.

My personal trick to figure out the comfort level of developers
in my team, is to create a dynamic where each of the members in
the team is responsible for knowing what I refer to as "shared tasks".
A shared task is i.e a task that more or less anyone in the team
can do with basic training and it is not something that requires
years of training to learn. Examples would be to, facilitate the
daily standup, check logs for errors and of course, configure a
build pipeline so automated tests and similar runs before the code
is deployed.
The dynamics I go for is similar to a teacher in school, who will
ask a random student during class if they can give an example
on a topic related to the subject being taught. This introduces
a way to spot check knowledge for the teacher and with a bit of
no prestige culture, creates an elegant way of reminding the class
to pay attention to at least the main lessons of the subject.

This pattern works for us developers as well. Simply make sure that
the people in the team who are the most confident in shared tasks
don't hog all the work for themselves and be more selective about
who picks up work that is not strictly outside their role in the
team. This puts the developers in a position where they will learn
how to handle a larger part of the end to end delivery.

## Should New Developers Choose Languages With Large Communities?

Yes, almost always.

The goal of coding professionally is to create a system that provides
some form of business value to your customer. This seems simple when
you hear it but often you will find that development teams seem to
forget this basic truth. They start bringing in tools and libraries
that can have questionable value and they do so most often because
of their own ideals.

If we go up a level from how a common software developer usually
thinks about the coding they do. As mentioned, the norm is that
they look at their work from their own perspective and that is a
perspective that usually focuses on their own preferences.
However, if try to look at development work from the eyes of the
company managers. Their ideal state would be that the development
is fast, the system works and it is easy to hire new people for
the project.

From a business perspective, these are factors that are more important
than the engineering details you and I may be focusing on as software
developers.

From this insight we can derive that when we are creating development
teams, the average company will favour to have projects that give them
an easy time to hire people and get them productive. This is naturally
not always how things play out but it is the most common desire.

This means that when we pick tech for development our goal should be
to pick tools that have a wide adoption. This means that we can find
people who know them and there is a large pool of knowledge that can
be tapped for the developers doing the work.

I have a directive that I give the teams I work with. "I care more
about how productive a junior developer is than how happy a senior
is with the tools we use.". The reasoning I use is that seniors are
at a level where using the boring mainstream tools will perhaps not
be the most exciting choice in the world for them, but they will be
able to meet the goals of the company. However, if we have a complicated
setup or a niched language choice, we may not be able to bring in
any juniors and we may even find it hard to get seniors who feel
comfortable with our stack.

I argue that on average picking a language with a large community is
a good choice, both for teams and for junior developers who are getting
in to the industry. The popularity of the language usually means that
you have a lot of peers that can share their knowledge and the market
usually has a decent supply of developers to pick from.

Languages who are less established or have smaller communities are
not a bad choice in any way, we just need to consider what choices
we are making and who benefits when we pick our tools. Especially
when our choices has an impact on the future of our projects and
perhaps our career.

## How Can Developers Demonstrate Their Value To Stakeholders?

The main way you become an asset to your stakeholders is by doing
the following 2 things.

First, speak with the voice of experience. Most of your stakeholders
don't know anything about your work or how programming works. This
means that they more or less have to trust what you tell them and
if you give them reason to doubt your expertise it will give them
an uneasy feeling.

Think about it a bit as if you go to the doctor or when you sit in
a plane. You don't really know anything about how medicine or planes
work but you feel calm if the people in charge are calm, collected
and seem to know what they are doing. You would probably be a bit
uneasy if they had bad communication skills, seemed like they
didn't really know their job or simply couldn't answer your questions.

Getting a experienced voice comes with years of work but it can help
to make sure that you can communicate effectively with your stakeholders.
Remember that they don't really know anything about your job so if
you can explain things to them so the feel that they understand to
some small extent, they will love working with you and they will
trust you. Trust is one of the most important things you can earn.
It is what allows you to pick your tools and what determines if you
get to refactor or not.

Second, connect mentally with your stakeholders. In other words we
commonly refer to this as having a business mindset.

This sounds fancy but the basic meaning is that you understand why
your are building the system, for who and what they are trying to
gain from the features they want.

If you are able to understand the stakeholders and come with suggestions
of how things can be done, present alternatives for work that can
be costly or explain the impact of their choices, they will love you
for it. Remember, they don't know your craft, they just want a good
system and if you can help guide them to that goal they will want
you to weigh in on almost all features they want.

To summarize, make your stakeholders feel like you know your craft.
Make them feel like you are listening to their needs and understand
them.

## What Are The Biggest Reasons Developers Leave Jobs?

The most common reasons are not as exciting as you may think.
Well, at least not in my experience.

Usually developers leave work for personal reasons, such as
relocating with family or similar. The second most common is
that they got a better offer from some other company. It is
not that often I see developers leaving a job just because
some other company offers them work but rather because they
have felt that they needed a change for a time and for whatever
reason, the company could not satisfy this need for them.

People outside the big club we call IT, imagine that developers
quit over bad code but in reality that is not the case.
Usually, developer complain about bad code but few feel so
strongly about it that they will risk their stable job over
something like that. In a way it is similar to people who learn
to adapt to poor working conditions in any job, from the outside
it seems odd but if you factor in job prospects and other similar
insecurities people in that job have, it starts to make more sense.

## How Can Developers Recognize When It’s Time To Move On?

It depends on your goals, as per usual.

My personal mantra is to always ask myself "is my job getting
me closer to my next goal"? It is that simple for me at least.

The reason I ask this question is because of a phenomenon that
is very human. It is the process of adjusting to things over
time. This is how you get spoiled kids who throw tantrums over
not getting their way, because their parents have conditioned
them to an environment where that is what they expect.
This is also how people can adjust to living in horrible conditions
that for the majority would be nightmarish. People can learn to
be ok with a lot.

For me this means that I have to commit myself to keeping my options
open. People who stay forever in the same job regardless if they
like it or hate it often have no other option or lack the will
to move on. This is how stagnation creeps in.

Stagnation is not the worst thing in the world and it happens to
everyone to some degree. It only becomes dangerous when it start
to affect your market value. As a developer your market value is
based on your ability to meet the current markets demand for coding
and that means knowing how to work in the stack used by the companies
you want to work for. If you are not able to keep a working understanding
of current tools and practices, you should consider moving on.

Safeguarding your long term career depends a lot on your ability to
understand at what phases of your career you will be and what will
be important to know at that point. This is why I always do a personal
reflection of what value I am adding to my CV with my current job on
a regular basis. A simple calendar reminder is enough for me to stop
and ponder if I have any better options to improve my market value
or improve my skills than what I have right now.

## What Should Developers Focus On When Starting A New Job?

Start by having your own personal workstation setup that you feel
really comfortable using. This is very important since if you feel
insecure in the tools you use to write code it will slow you down
and it will impact your mood. Think about your choices in editors
and other tools as a musician and their instrument. It is your most
important tool for your job so make sure you know it well.

Once you have a setup that you know well and allows you to write code
the way you feel comfortable, get the source code on your workstation
and get a local version of the system working. The quicker you can
get this setup the better because now you can start trying out the
system and see how it works without any risk.

Next, find out who knows the most about what. Regardless if you are
a junior or a senior, you won't know how things work in this new
company without a bit of guidance. In every company there is almost
always a few people who know a lot about various areas of the system
and the workflows. These we sometimes refer to as domain experts.
Find them, be nice to them and make sure you have easy access to them.
They will be very important to you until you learn enough about the
system so you can manage on your own.

## How Can Developers Maintain A Long-term Career In Tech?

Understand what skills you need at any one point in time and
position yourself to always be learning what you need for one
of two important things.

Number one, market value. This is by far the most important observation
any craftsman can make. Know the market you work in and what people
are paying for. Your choices in tools and framework should ideally
be somewhat aligned with the market. It is fine to deviate, after all,
IT is large and diverse. However, make sure that you understand that
learning a cool library or picking up a obscure programming language
may be fun and teach you new things, but it will likely not be a
strong selling point when it comes time to send in your CV.

Second, understand your career phases and what matters most in
each phase. As a junior, your focus should be to learn the coding so
you can ship code with as little assistance as possible. This is how
you get to be a mid level developer, where the sweet-spot is for most
professional programmers. During this phase you focus should be to
mature your understanding of how to build systems of various kinds.
What type of surrounding services and tools are common. Things like
different type of cloud providers, databases, practices and so on
will benefit you a lot when it comes time to step in to the promised
land of seniors.

Well, congrats. You made it. Now you are a senior. This is where it
gets tricky to predict what will benefit you because it will be down
to how the market shifts and what your own goals are. As a general
rule, it is worth making sure you master how to get software from an
idea phase, to planning out backlog items and all the way to production.
This flow is always the most important in all companies you will work
in and it will be invaluable to understand even if you want to move
in to leadership in the future.

## What Are The Challenges Of Onboarding Developers To Complex Projects?

Almost always, I find that the main issue is that complex systems or
just very poorly made systems require the developer to know half the
codebase before they feel confident to change a variable name.

Sometimes we refer to this state as spaghetti code but I argue that
this terms is a poor choice here because code that is "bad" and
a system that simply has been architected in an complex fashion
can be equally responsible for developers having a tough onboarding.

This is a state that is potentially one of the worst states for a company
to be in. It means that hiring new people and getting them productive
is costly and losing trained staff can be catastrophic. If you want
know how to avoid this, I will sell you a book later that is at least
three times as expensive as this one.

The onboarding is a good way to, in a very coarse manner, get a
sense of how your systems form is looking. If your developer struggle
to teach others the system and new people struggle to deliver, you
may want to take this as a sign to take action before it gets worse.

## What Best Practices Ensure Effective Onboarding For New Developers?

Start by making a simple onboarding step by step guide. It should just
be a simple checklist with links and instructions of how to get the
new developer up and running with a local setup of the system. Add
visual aids when needed but keep the content focused on helping them
get their development environment working so they can start writing
code.

Avoid creating excessive system diagrams and overviews. Favour instead
having a session with the developer where the team goes through the
systems main features, what the infrastructure looks like and what
supporting systems you use to monitor and deliver to production.

Finally, create one or two small work tasks for the developer that
lets them commit some minor code changes and deliver that code to
a production environment, end to end. This will help them understand
how the workflow looks without needing to take on a big task early.

For good measure, make sure that you have documentation of important
contacts outside of the team and common tasks that may need to be done
on a semi regular basis.

## What Are The Risks Of Rushing The Onboarding Process For New Developers?

The main risk is that their code won't work or it will cause issues
for other developers. We have to remember that their code is likely
connected to other code and if we want to feel secure in that this
new code will work and that it won't break the current code, we need
to be sure that the new developer knows enough to handle the tasks
given to them.

A good method to help mitigate this risk is to pick tasks for the new
developer that requires less system knowledge to deliver. Some code
changes are core to the entire system and can potentially require very
deep knowledge of the system. This will be a bit much usually to start
with but then there are areas of the code that are more isolated where
adding new code or changing the existing code is less risky and requires
only basic understanding of the area of the code.

This is an ideal place to start a new developer on. It gives them a
chance to learn some part of the system before we throw them in to
the deep end where they will need to understand a large part of the
system before they can change anything.

## How To Build Effective Onboarding Programs For Junior Developers?

I argue that hiring juniors is something you should only do if you
know that you have people who are able and willing to mentor them.

If you do have the right people, the next step is to create a roadmap
of work. I usually say that the first thing to do is to write down
a step by step guide on how to get the local development environment
up and running. The goal is for the reader to have the right accesses,
configs and anything else they need to start working in place after
completing the list.

The juniors first task is to complete this onboarding guide. It will
give you as the mentor a good feeling for how comfortable they are
with the tools you are using in the project. If they struggle with
installing tools or following directions from the guide, you gain
insight in to what you will need to help them with.

Once the guide has been completed and the junior can work with a local
setup, you should give them a intro task. Pick something arbitrary
that is as easy as you can make it or pick something from the backlog.
The goal of this task is just to give the junior a small task that
will help them understand how code goes from their workstation in to
production. By the end of that first task, they will have experienced
how the teams workflow looks.

Observe the juniors comfort levels during this phase so you can spot
any areas of discomfort for them and take measures to prepare work
that will help them improve their understanding of those areas.

Finally, device your roadmap as a onion model where the junior starts
on tasks that are on the outer layers and by mastering work that require
less in-depth knowledge about the system, they "earn" the option of
working on tasks that are more complex until the reach the center of
the onion.

I am a big fan of using a gateway system of evaluation. The idea being
that you prepare a roadmap of tasks that get increasingly more complex
as the junior proves that they can handle the work.
