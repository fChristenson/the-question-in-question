## Should You Consider Scalability For Resume Projects?

No, not at all. Most developers overestimate how much their pet
projects matter to the companies they apply to. If they work with
end customers I can basically promise you that the average customer
will care more about how nice the UI looks than if it runs on a
scalable stack.

The average recruiter won't know what scalability is and frankly, most
don't have the time or skills to deep dive in to a candidates personal
projects. Most people struggle to read the details in a meeting invite,
so I can say with a fair amount of certainty that you won't see them
dive in to the details of your project. There are of course people
who do but it is not the norm.

I advice developer to treat their resume projects as a shop owner treats
their shop window. The key to hooking a customer is to put a nice sign
up and put eye catching items in the window. Treat your projects the
same way. Front the appeal of the project and don't overestimate how
much technical details matter. Most recruiters will be swayed more
by how the project looks and what the main tools are than if you
wrote unit tests or if you have checked the security posture.

## Is Long-term Job Satisfaction In Software Tied To Personal Development?

That is a tricky question. For me, absolutely. However, we should
consider that, although personal growth is at large a human desire,
it may not always be the most important factor in a professional
environment. I have on many occasions had conversations with
developers who felt that their peers did not show enthusiasm
for their ideas about better ways of doing work or new tech to use.
I explained to them that although they may be right about how much
better things would get if the peers changed their ideas of how
to work, it is perhaps not something they are interested in.
For people who are truly engaged and want to work at the bleeding
edge, this seems to be pure blasphemy but let me try to play
devils advocate.

I am sure that if you think about it, you have several things
that you could improve in your daily job. You could probably
spend more time at the gym or read more books or buy better
items for your home. If we follow this idea to it's end you
will at some point, I hope, agree that although this is true,
you are simply not interested in owning the best version of
everything or working out so much that you can compete at a
professional level and so on. In other words, you have a limit
of how much energy you are willing to spend on an area of your
life. Your coworkers are doing exactly the same thing.

You may find the work you do to be something that your team
should pour the most amount of energy in to so that you can
be "the best" at it but for most people it is just a job.
It is a means to make a living. Their energy is likely being
spent on other things than trying to grow as a developer.
Right or wrong, I think we can agree that the average worker
is not trying to be the best at their job, they are simply trying
as hard as they feel is appropriate to live comfortably.

This can be a tough pill to swallow for the achievers of the world.
You may find that you want to push things to be better but the
people around you don't really care about the work as much as you.
This doesn't mean that they don't grow as people. It just means that
they are putting their energy somewhere else. You may wish that they
would put it in to their work but it will save you a lot of frustration
if you can determine if there is a chance for that to happen or if
you should look to spend more time with people who do put a lot of
energy in to growing within the work they do.

## What Happens To Developers In Big It Companies As They Age?

This varies a lot but on average they go in to management or
similar administrative work. There is of course a breed who
stick to their coding until they retire but based on my experience
the average age of the developers range from people in their 20's
to their late 40's whereas the age of people working in management,
especially the higher levels, have a range of 40's and above.

There are plenty of exceptions to these age ranges so take what I
am sharing for what it is, a personal observation from someone who
has been in the industry for a few years.

## How Can It Companies Help New Developers With Onboarding?

I usually suggest that company policy is for the tech lead to
be responsible for making a onboarding guide that is documented
and kept up to date. The goal of the guide is to get the developer
up and running with their local development environment and give
them access to all the systems they need to do their work.

Apart from getting things up and running, I recommend that the
team pick out a few basic stories that will help the developer
learn how the delivery process works. These stories can be tiny
bugfixes or anything really that is possible to do in less than
a day. The goal is to put them on something small so they can
ship something and through doing that, understand how the team
does code reviews, testing and deployments.

I suggest you have a few smaller stories ready and then ease the
developer in to large scope work depending on their progress.

Lastly, make sure that the developers in the team understand that
at least one of them has to reserve time to answer question and
in some cases do pair programming. This needs to be communicated
to them and to the stakeholders so the developer can reserve the
time without fear of falling behind on their own work.

## Is It A Zero-sum Game For Tech Leads To Praise Their Teams?

I am not sure how to answer this. My way of giving praise has
mostly been about noticing growth in the people I work with.
I make a note of when someone shows progress or is able to
execute a task that was either helpful to the team or was
outside of what they knew how to do before. In other words,
praise comes with growth, when you are getting it from me.

I don't praise people on a regular basis as I prefer to keep
it genuine and focused on building pride in the work we do.
If the developers in my team show engagement and try to help
me ensure that the team meets the expectations put on us,
they shower in praise and all of it comes straight from the
heart. I don't care if it is a junior learning how to write
code so there are no mistakes or a senior who handled an
adhoc request when they usually never offer to help, if you
show that you care about helping the team deliver better
results, I will praise it.

Conversely, if you show none of this, you will never hear
a compliment come out of my mouth. Maybe, if you have a
really nice sweater on.
