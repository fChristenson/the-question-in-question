## How Do You Choose A Tech Project?

I pick them mostly based on if I think I will learn something.
Most of my personal projects are about exploring the way I think
and trying to see if I can create something that makes sense.

I have tried to make a range of things to see if the project will
teach me something or let me try out an idea I am a bit unsure about.
These are the projects I find the most thrilling.

For work purposes I usually have the same mindset. To me the main focus
has always been to be the best I can be at whatever I find interesting.
I can't recall ever caring about anything else. What I find interesting
has changed over time but the goal is always the same. Find something
that will develop my skills, do it until I feel confident and then
move on.

## Why Do Tech Job Titles Often Seem Unclear?

I argue that it is a bit due to how vague a roles responsibility
can be. The role Site reliability engineer for example. Where do
you draw a box around that role? It could literally mean anything
depending on who you ask. The same could be said about many roles
that are common for our industry. DevOps engineer is another. Where
do we draw the line between a DevOps engineer and a System admin?

Today we are still debating the details of many role definitions
that are standard for many companies. Now let us imagine what happens
if the role we are trying to define is less generic and more tied to
specific business workflows. As we can imagine, we quickly get roles
such as Release engineer or Automation engineer and the list can
go on for a while. I am pretty sure that we can extend this until
we start naming roles that are so obscure that the person who has
it needs a slide presentation to explain what they do for a living
and why it matters.

## How Do Career Ladders In It Companies Work?

Career ladders differ a bit in their details for each company
but the general idea is almost always the same. We have some
set of roles that go from the lowest level up until some top
level. The roles in the ladder and their names differ and can
at times include levels within the role, such as Senior Engineer
1, 2, 3... and so on.

The general way they work is by describing what each role requires
from the employee and what type of characteristics the company looks
for in a person who has this role. Usually it is the manager who
together with the developer decides if the criteria for a promotion
are met. Often the developer is asked to provide proof of actions
they have taken that show that they fill the roles criteria. It
is common for the manager to also gather feedback from coworkers
of the developer to inform the decision.

## How To Deal With Impostor Syndrome In Software Development?

In my experience people are on a spectrum of how much impostor
syndrome affects them. Some of us seem nearly immune to it
and some are crippled by it. I know senior developers who have
a long history of major achievements in the field and they still
feel insecure about their abilities. What I am trying to say is
that all I can give you my tip on how I managed to overcome
impostor syndrome but you should look at it as a fear to be
overcome rather than something that you expect to go away
forever. It's a bit like overcoming fear of heights. You may
be fine going up a high building but if we put you on a tightrope
hovering a fall that would mean instant death on impact you
will probably see your life flash.

The key to overcoming impostor syndrome for me was when I finally
understood that I could meet the expectations of the industry.
I reflected on my journey thus far and came to realize that
although I was by no means the best developer who has ever lived,
I did know enough to make my deadlines. I did know how to fix
the bugs the system had. I did know that I could estimate roughly
how much time it would take me to build something that needed to
be built. In short, I had reached a point where the work of a
developer no longer held anything uncertain or scary for me.

I urge you to think in similar terms. If you feel confident in
that you can meet the expectations of your stakeholders at least
admit to yourself that you are good enough to do that much.
Sure you can be better and with practice you will be but at least
admit that you have the needed value to do the job. When I acknowledged
to myself that in fact, I did know how to do the job well enough, nearly
all anxiety faded. I would not go as far as saying that I had none
left, there is always some anxiety to spare for those days when
I least need it but at least on average I felt pretty good.

I suggest that the way to overcome the impostor syndrome is
to work at your craft until you feel that you can deliver
working software in accordance with expectations. Once you
know that you can, what remains is your own insecurity over
not being even better. At that point I suggest you acknowledge
that you may always to some extent feel that you could be better
and I hope you use that anxiety to keep learning. However, allow
yourself to at least feel good about that you have gone from someone
who can't write a single line of code to someone who can do it at a
professional level. That is a major achievement and you are allowed
to feel good about it.

I believe fear is best handled by exposure. If you build confidence
in whatever you are scared of you will see that fear hold less control
over you. So do just that, practice. Learn the trade, get a job,
do it and when you have done it for a while, acknowledge that you
may still feel anxious about some things but you have at least made
progress.
