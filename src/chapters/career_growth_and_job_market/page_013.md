## What Would You Say To A Ceo Who Belittles Your Work?

Not much. I have been on the opposing side of enough people
to feel comfortable being doubted. I expect to be treated with
the respect anyone is due regardless of who I speak to but further
than that I don't push my expectations on other people.

Given that the CEO in question has some ideas on what my work
is lacking, I am more than happy to hear them. I have made a
note of never becoming too sure of that I am correct about what
I believe. The method I have used for years is to simply keep
all code I ever wrote since my school days so that when I get
too full of myself I can go back and see the quality of work
I used to do. The experience is unpleasant and cringe worthy
but it does help for me.

Once I have an idea of what the issue the CEO has is with my
work I ask myself the only question I ever really ponder when
questions of performance become a topic of review.
The question is "given our current situation, are these results
within reasonable expectations?".
The power of this question is best described with an example I
like to use. If you hire a company of movers to move your
belongings, there are reasonable expectations to consider.
Odds or that a group of average people will show up to your
door and do the work. If you expect them to be bodybuilders
your expectations are probably not realistic. However, if a group
of frail people who can barely move anything appears, it is
reasonable to expect more from people who move things professionally.

If the CEO expects high results and they don't have an understanding
of what is realistic, why would I care about their viewpoint. At
best it is a viewpoint of someone who doesn't have realistic
expectations and so arguing with them is pointless. I simply
try my best to explain why the results look as they do.
I find that this usually is enough for a rationally minded person
and then we make a action plan to improve the situation.
However, if the CEO is not a reasonable person and is simply
out to vent frustration I ask myself if I am overall happy with
how my place of work treats me. If I am, I treat the CEO as any
person I don't get along with but want to have a professional
relationship with. Otherwise I look at my options and move on.

## Whatâ€™s The Best Way To Address Performance Issues?

This is a tricky one and all I can say is that it will always
depend on the specific situation. The main thing I want to
propose to you before we go further is to consider if the
performance issue you see in someone is a real problem or
if it simply feels like they could do better. I have often
found myself and others around me question someones productivity
and I just as many probably can relate to, have feel frustrated
over what I have seen. However, I think it is worth asking how
often you have felt the same frustration over the performance
of people in other situations. I can imagine that there are
many chefs around the world who goes to a restaurant and
are appalled by the quality of the food. Yet I am willing
to be that had I eaten the food I would probably feel pretty
happy about a lot of the dishes served. The point I am making
is that what we consider good performance and bad performance
will always be subjective but the real question is if the person
doing the work does it well enough to meet the expectations
of the people who depend on it. You can always argue that there
is someone who can do it better and often you will be right but
for the most part we don't need, and likely can't find, the person
who will be the very best at something so we settle for someone
who is good enough.

When I need to provide feedback on performance I usually start
by figuring out what the core issue is. I argue that there are
things that a company can in a reasonable time fix so the
main issues are no longer a concern but there are also things
that may take too long or require too much to be a viable option.

If I find that the core issue is with a specific tool or process
that seems hard to grasp, then I am pretty happy. This is usually
something that can be fixed by helping the developer with some
coaching sessions.
However, if the issue is that they struggle to solve programming
problems and I can see that this is a repeating patterns, it
is something that is of concern.

Usually in cases like these I try to hand-pick work that may
be simpler to see if the situation improves. If it does we
can try to work something out. However, if the issues remain
I usually recommend that an action plan is made with some
evaluation period to determine if the developer can raise
their skill level to an acceptable level. In some cases this
is enough but sadly I may need to replace the developer if
the situation does not improve.
