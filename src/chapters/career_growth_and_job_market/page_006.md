## Why Do Large Companies Hire So Many Developers?

Usually it is because the project stakeholders defer the
practical hiring to engineering managers. These managers
are the ones who are doing the hiring based on how big a
project is and the budget they get for staffing.

Based on their knowledge they will hire and as you can imagine,
for really big companies they have a lot of projects so that
becomes a decent amount of people quickly.
However, it is worth knowing that because it is very difficult
to predict how productive a developer will be or how many people
you will need and of course keeping track of who is doing what
in a large company, it is almost inevitable that large companies
end up with a lot of people who work on similar things without
knowing about each other or building projects that may not be
needed as much as others.
This is one of the main incentives large companies have for
mass layoffs.
This cycle is very common, company grows it staff to handle
new projects, development with varying results happen and
then the company does mass layoffs to balance the budget.
What remains is often the staff that the managers want to
keep and then it starts over again.

## Is Developer Compensation Proportional To Productivity?

No, compensation is usually based on more complex factors.

Compensation is impacted by many things but a few main ones are:

- Where you work
- How well you do it
- For who
- As what
- With what
- How good you are at negotiating
- How long you have been working

Just as the riches people in the world are not always the
people who work the hardest or are the most gifted. So is your
compensation is not necessarily tied to how good your code is.

## Why Do Tech Job Titles Often Seem Unclear?

Usually it is a reflection of the company internals and their structure.
What this in practice means is that companies name roles depending
on semantics that make sense to their own corporate structure.
If a company has a need for a role that is common within the
industry at large they will use that name but for more complex
roles they will invent something or borrow names that roughly
fits the bill.

The main thing to know is that a title is a bit like when you
name a function in programming. For a simple function the name
will be easy and make total sense but for a really big function
that does many things the name can almost not be written so well
that it captures the logic in the function.
Titles work the same way in many ways. There is an element of
importance inflation to account for as well. This means that
often titles will sound appealing to promote the importance
and competence of the person doing the job. You will at times
find that someone has amazing skills but have a title that does
not reflect it and of course you will find people with fancy
titles who seem to know next to nothing.

## Is It True That You Need an Hour to Evaluate a Developer?

I would say I need less but that depends on the communication
style of the developer. In general an hour is the amount of time
I prefer to have with a candidate since the interview I conduct
touches on many areas and I want to give the candidate as much
time as needed so we can have the most relaxed conversation
possible. However it does usually not take more than a few
minutes to figure out if a candidate is under-qualified or not.
It takes a lot longer if they are really good since then we
can get in to details to figure out just how good they are.

The best tips I can give is to prepare a list of questions
that are designed to ask about specific tools and practices
that all developer will at some point have used. The reason
behind this is so you can listen to the experience level of
the developer. If you ask very open questions such as "what
was your greatest achievement in your previous role?", you
can kiss your other questions goodbye. The candidate can
easily spend the whole session talking about this topic
but by the end of the interview you won't actually know what
they know and what they don't know.

A question that is designed with more care would be, "what
type of css preprocessor have you used and how do they compare
in your opinion?", or if we are talking to a backend developer,
"what is an ORM and when do you use one?".
These are questions that will force the conversation to be about
concrete experiences the developer has had and then it is easy
to hear if they are familiar with the practical tasks of the role
they are applying for.

The key weakness in this approach is that the interviewer needs
to know what will be relevant to ask about for the given role.
As a rule I suggest that your most socially gifted developers
perform the interviews. This gives you the best chance to do
an accurate evaluation of practical knowledge, which I argue
is what matters most when hiring an engineer apart from having
good social skills.

In my experience the best developers can answer these sorts of
questions with a good amount of depth, because they have been
around and tried a few things out. Be wary of developers who
can't give you any details and keep their answers vague.
This is a common way to speak when you don't know
how to answer.
