## How to Balance Team Specialization With Generalist Skills in Development?

The answer lies in what type of system you are making. There is a flaw
the reasoning about being a specialist or being a generalist I would
like to point out. If we intend to reach the peak of something such
as becoming the worlds top marathon runner, then we do need to focus
our efforts on a narrow area to reach that goal. However, if we intend
to be the worlds top investor we will need to learn a range of things
in order to develop an ability to analyze markets, earn capital to
invest and so on. The same is true for software engineering and in
fact any engineering if you ask me. We have tasks that need someone
who is a true master of a narrow area and then we have more general
tasks that require less specialization. Which you need depends on the
system.

Once we know if our system has features that need developers of above
average skill we can figure out how to staff our team. The tricky part
here is to know when we are making a system like this and for those
of us who have not worked for many years with a range of developers,
what is average skill? I argue that to find the right team composition
you need to start with what the average workday will look like.
If you intend to make a system that works with some basic CRUD features
on some basic business requirements, then you will probably only need
to consider getting people who can manage a basic DevOps workflow.
However, if we are making a system that will have for example Machine
learning analytics built in to the overall CRUD features, then we need
to ponder adding someone who is specialized in that area since we more
or less know that we won't be able to find someone who can do that
part and the DevOps work on top of it.

As a good rule of thumb I suggest you ask yourself if you have any
features that require specialist knowledge. Most of the time you don't
so getting people who are a bit broader is a good bet. If you find
that you need someone with more in depth knowledge you can add them
later. Just make sure that you understand what areas of the system
will be manageable for a developer with a broader profile and what
areas requires a specialist. It is often easier to split work in to
the overall system development and a niche area. Taking the example
of Machine learning again. You probably want the generalists to build
the CRUD system which is perhaps 80% of the codebase and the model
you are making to analyze the data with is perhaps only 20% but those
are some damn hard 20% to make, so you hire people who are great at
that.

## How can developers build the confidence to make a career move?

Start by checking your market value. This may seem obvious but
it is often our mental model of what is true is a bit out of
alignment with the world around us. This is how you get some
who believe that everything about them is great and some who
seem to feel the opposite.

How do I know my market value, you ask. Well, it is simple.
Start by looking over your CV, make it nice and presentable.
Update a few things, put a stock photo of you doing something
respectable as your profile picture and then when you feel good
and ready, apply for jobs. Practice applying for jobs by checking
how close your skills are to those in demand. Practice applying
for jobs by seeing if you can handle an interview. If you fail
to get any callbacks, your market value is low.

So how do we fix it? Easy, develop your skills in the tools that
are in demand, learn how to do an interview and practice.
You may never feel comfortable changing your career but
the closest you can get to confidence in it is by feeling the
gap being narrow enough that it is worth to take a risk.

## What If You Took the Wrong Job in IT?

This is highly likely to happen at some point. Mostly due to how hard
it is to know what you are actually going to be doing once you start.
The tricky part about developing software is that there are so many
ways to do it. I often find it hard to connect with other developers
since we can come from such different tech stacks. It can at times
be hard to understand each other if our tech jargon doesn't overlap.
However, the good news is that there are some tells of how you figure
out if the job you are about to take is good or not. We should also
consider how we figure out if a job is "good" or not and what to do
if it turns out we want to switch.

First, ask yourself where you are in your career right now? Some of
of us have done work for years and some are just starting. What we
need next my also differ based on our ambitions. What do you want to
be able to do in the future? These are the two main questions you should
ask before taking action.

Once you know what you are looking for, check around. It may be that
you have the opportunity to adjust your work in your current company.
If however, you don't have that option or perhaps the reason for you
not wanting to stay is more than just your personal growth, you are
left with only one option. Go somewhere else. So how do we do that?
I am glad you asked.

Your first move should be to determine your market value. If you want
to be able to have options when looking for work you need to sell what
people are buying. Check the job postings for the sort of companies
you want to work for and figure out what tech they use.
Once you know what your market value is, either start applying for
jobs and/or educate yourself on the tech that is new too you.
During this period I find that it is a great idea to look at your current
work as payed learning. Make sure you pick the tasks that will grow
your skills. In fact, you should always be doing this if you ask me.

## How to Convince Your Boss That a Certificate Is a Waste of Time?

The simplest way is to explain that the certificate is just proof
that you know a topic. If your boss feels that there is value in
having that proof, there is little you can argue for. It is a bit
like trying to argue that you don't need a degree to be good
at something but as most of us can agree, it is hard to fight
against peoples prejudices.

To make a a good case I argue that we should remind ourselves
that there are some who have dropped out of school and gone on
to become immensely successful. However, I argue that the reason
for their success without a degree, is due to their ability to
deliver value. Value is what means something, not the paper you
get when you have graduated.

In other words, show your manager that you know what the certificate
aims to prove. If you know how to create the value you are already
creating the benefit of having an education.

Arguing for that practical skills and creating value is more important
than having a certificate is usually a straightforward dialogue but
if you are up against someone who wants you to get more things to add
to your CV or someone who is less reasonable, you can't win.

My favorite tip in situations like these is to be a lazy employee.
It is a trick as old as management. Make it hard for someone to get
something and they will likely forget about it and move on.
We lovingly call it at times to "kill it by backlog". This means that
we all know that if something isn't very important to the right people
we will just make a backlog item and promise to look at it later. As
you can guess, that part rarely happens. You can do the same here.

## How can developers cultivate the mindset of a senior engineer?

It is a bit like growing up if you ask me. You start by just playing
with code, trying to make it work. You keep messing up over and over,
until you start to feel pretty good about a few things. After that,
you start building a little confidence and you experiment with new
ways of doing things. Now you start meeting some people who may have
different ideas from your own and you learn how to argue your point
and deal with the frustration of not getting your way. Finally, you
start getting tired of dealing with excess complexity and ineffective
solutions, coworkers and leadership. Congratulations, now you are a
bitter old senior.

The mindset you grow is best described as a mature one.
If you want to start cultivating it early on I can summarize your focus
area like this.

Focus on creating code that is made to make your customer happy.

Why is this so important? I argue that the mark of a true senior is
that they have tried out a range of ways to make software. It is
by doing this they learn when to use one approach over another.
However, there is a category of people who start to forget why they
are making code in the first place. Usually it is to deliver some type
of business value, for us who work as professional developers.
This is an important point because if we forget this, we tend to make
solutions that are overly complex or using tech that may not be the
best fit for the situation.
This is where a senior mindset makes itself known. The trick is to
know through experience what ways there is to solve a given problem
and then pick the one that is best for your customer, not for you.

I have a saying, "understand the problem that you are solving".
This sentence I use to explain what I have been stating in these
paragraphs. As a senior your mind should always be focused on making
the right choice for the given situation. Being able to do that is
only possible by experimenting with different approaches, learning
from them and then being focused on the goal of the project.
Experiment to your hearts content when the time is right but never
forget that your choices in a professional environment, should always
be to benefit the customer.
