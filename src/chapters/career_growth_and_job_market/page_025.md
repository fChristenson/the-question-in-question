## How To Balance Team Specialization With Generalist Skills In Development?

The answer lies in what type of system you are making. There is a flaw
the reasoning about being a specialist or being a generalist I would
like to point out. If we intend to reach the peak of something such
as becoming the worlds top marathon runner, then we do need to focus
our efforts on a narrow area to reach that goal. However, if we intend
to be the worlds top investor we will need to learn a range of things
in order to develop an ability to analyze markets, earn capital to
invest and so on. The same is true for software engineering and in
fact any engineering if you ask me. We have tasks that need someone
who is a true master of a narrow area and then we have more general
tasks that require less specialization. Which you need depends on the
system.

Once we know if our system has features that need developers of above
average skill we can figure out how to staff our team. The tricky part
here is to know when we are making a system like this and for those
of us who have not worked for many years with a range of developers,
what is average skill? I argue that to find the right team composition
you need to start with what the average workday will look like.
If you intend to make a system that works with some basic CRUD features
on some basic business requirements, then you will probably only need
to consider getting people who can manage a basic DevOps workflow.
However, if we are making a system that will have for example Machine
learning analytics built in to the overall CRUD features, then we need
to ponder adding someone who is specialized in that area since we more
or less know that we won't be able to find someone who can do that
part and the DevOps work on top of it.

As a good rule of thumb I suggest you ask yourself if you have any
features that require specialist knowledge. Most of the time you don't
so getting people who are a bit broader is a good bet. If you find
that you need someone with more in depth knowledge you can add them
later. Just make sure that you understand what areas of the system
will be manageable for a developer with a broader profile and what
areas requires a specialist. It is often easier to split work in to
the overall system development and a niche area. Taking the example
of Machine learning again. You probably want the generalists to build
the CRUD system which is perhaps 80% of the codebase and the model
you are making to analyze the data with is perhaps only 20% but those
are some damn hard 20% to make, so you hire people who are great at
that.

## How Can Developers Build The Confidence To Make A Career Move?

Start by checking your market value. This may seem obvious but
it is often our mental model of what is true is a bit out of
alignment with the world around us. This is how you get some
who believe that everything about them is great and some who
seem to feel the opposite.

How do I know my market value, you ask. Well, it is simple.
Start by looking over your CV, make it nice and presentable.
Update a few things, put a stock photo of you doing something
respectable as your profile picture and then when you feel good
and ready, apply for jobs. Practice applying for jobs by checking
how close your skills are to those in demand. Practice applying
for jobs by seeing if you can handle an interview. If you fail
to get any callbacks, your market value is low.

So how do we fix it? Easy, develop your skills in the tools that
are in demand, learn how to do an interview and practice.
You may never feel comfortable changing your career but
the closest you can get to confidence in it is by feeling the
gap being narrow enough that it is worth to take a risk.

## What If You Took The Wrong Job In It?

This is highly likely to happen at some point. Mostly due to how hard
it is to know what you are actually going to be doing once you start.
The tricky part about developing software is that there are so many
ways to do it. I often find it hard to connect with other developers
since we can come from such different tech stacks. It can at times
be hard to understand each other if our tech jargon doesn't overlap.
However, the good news is that there are some tells of how you figure
out if the job you are about to take is good or not. We should also
consider how we figure out if a job is "good" or not and what to do
if it turns out we want to switch.

First, ask yourself where you are in your career right now? Some of
of us have done work for years and some are just starting. What we
need next my also differ based on our ambitions. What do you want to
be able to do in the future? These are the two main questions you should
ask before taking action.

Once you know what you are looking for, check around. It may be that
you have the opportunity to adjust your work in your current company.
If however, you don't have that option or perhaps the reason for you
not wanting to stay is more than just your personal growth, you are
left with only one option. Go somewhere else. So how do we do that?
I am glad you asked.

Your first move should be to determine your market value. If you want
to be able to have options when looking for work you need to sell what
people are buying. Check the job postings for the sort of companies
you want to work for and figure out what tech they use.
Once you know what your market value is, either start applying for
jobs and/or educate yourself on the tech that is new too you.
During this period I find that it is a great idea to look at your current
work as payed learning. Make sure you pick the tasks that will grow
your skills. In fact, you should always be doing this if you ask me.

## How To Convince Your Boss That A Certificate Is A Waste Of Time?

The simplest way is to explain that the certificate is just proof
that you know a topic. If your boss feels that there is value in
having that proof, there is little you can argue for. It is a bit
like trying to argue that you don't need a degree to be good
at something but as most of us can agree, it is hard to fight
against peoples prejudices.

To make a a good case I argue that we should remind ourselves
that there are some who have dropped out of school and gone on
to become immensely successful. However, I argue that the reason
for their success without a degree, is due to their ability to
deliver value. Value is what means something, not the paper you
get when you have graduated.

In other words, show your manager that you know what the certificate
aims to prove. If you know how to create the value you are already
creating the benefit of having an education.

Arguing for that practical skills and creating value is more important
than having a certificate is usually a straightforward dialogue but
if you are up against someone who wants you to get more things to add
to your CV or someone who is less reasonable, you can't win.

My favorite tip in situations like these is to be a lazy employee.
It is a trick as old as management. Make it hard for someone to get
something and they will likely forget about it and move on.
We lovingly call it at times to "kill it by backlog". This means that
we all know that if something isn't very important to the right people
we will just make a backlog item and promise to look at it later. As
you can guess, that part rarely happens. You can do the same here.

## How Can Developers Cultivate The Mindset Of A Senior Engineer?

It is a bit like growing up if you ask me. You start by just playing
with code, trying to make it work. You keep messing up over and over,
until you start to feel pretty good about a few things. After that,
you start building a little confidence and you experiment with new
ways of doing things. Now you start meeting some people who may have
different ideas from your own and you learn how to argue your point
and deal with the frustration of not getting your way. Finally, you
start getting tired of dealing with excess complexity and ineffective
solutions, coworkers and leadership. Congratulations, now you are a
bitter old senior.

The mindset you grow is best described as a mature one.
If you want to start cultivating it early on I can summarize your focus
area like this.

Focus on creating code that is made to make your customer happy.

Why is this so important? I argue that the mark of a true senior is
that they have tried out a range of ways to make software. It is
by doing this they learn when to use one approach over another.
However, there is a category of people who start to forget why they
are making code in the first place. Usually it is to deliver some type
of business value, for us who work as professional developers.
This is an important point because if we forget this, we tend to make
solutions that are overly complex or using tech that may not be the
best fit for the situation.
This is where a senior mindset makes itself known. The trick is to
know through experience what ways there is to solve a given problem
and then pick the one that is best for your customer, not for you.

I have a saying, "understand the problem that you are solving".
This sentence I use to explain what I have been stating in these
paragraphs. As a senior your mind should always be focused on making
the right choice for the given situation. Being able to do that is
only possible by experimenting with different approaches, learning
from them and then being focused on the goal of the project.
Experiment to your hearts content when the time is right but never
forget that your choices in a professional environment, should always
be to benefit the customer.

## What Should You Know Before Applying For An Entry-level Job?

I would say the main things are as follows.

- Make sure your CV is eye catching
- Practice the technologies used in the company
- Be prepared to onboard yourself

Most of the time junior developers are viewed as an investment.
This in practice means that you get picked mostly based on 2 things.
How much potential you show and how well you interact with the people
working at the company.

Your best bet is to make sure your CV is filled with things that prove
that you care about programming. Take extra courses, become an an
amateur influencer, contribute to open source project and the list
can go on and on. The aim is to make your CV stand out. This is how
you get a callback and without a callback you won't get further.

Next comes passing the interview. This will be down to how well you
know your tech and how good you are at social interactions.
You goal is to be able to answer questions related to tech, ideally
tech used in the company. Remember, you don't have to know everything,
you just have to show that you have put real effort in to developing
your skills.

During the interview your social goal should be to leave the interviewer
with a good gut feeling. Although it is an interview and people try
to be objective in their assessments of candidates, most of time who
gets hired is one part experience and one part how the interviewer
felt after.

Lastly, once you start working, your main goal is to get productive
in the most autonomous way you can. Each company is different in how
much support they can give to their developers. This means that your
best strategy is to actively seek out people who can show you what
you need to know in order to become self reliant. The quickest way
to becoming a mid level developer is to know enough to deliver software
without needing to ask for help several times a day. We all need help
at times but you will be better off long term if you use you apply
real effort in to learning how to find answers to your questions
without depending on that your coworkers do the work for you.

## Why Is Having A Career Gap On A Cv Viewed Negatively?

It depends on the gap and the person doing the review. In general
however it is not something that will stand out much. My personal
suggestion is that you view your CV as a record that tells a story
of your professional life. No reasonable person will dismiss a CV
that shows that the candidate has relevant experience, based on a
gap alone. There may be some questions related to the gap or any
other peculiarities but as long as you have a good explanation to
them, you will be fine.

## Is Knowing How To Get The Right Support A Key Skill For Senior Developers?

Yes, it is the main difference between juniors and mid level developers
if you ask me. Juniors are viewed as a investment to many companies
due to that they need support and that takes time away from others.
The most common expectation on a more experienced developer, apart
from the speed at which they deliver code, is how capable they are
to work independently. Everyone needs help at times but you will do
well to learn how to best figure out the answer to your own questions.
Each company you work for will have different people and they will
all view giving support in different ways. Some are really helpful
and some are annoyed by it so hope for the best and prepare for
the worst.

## Should You Accept A Job If The Company Uses Cloud Computing?

This is a bit like asking if you should marry someone if they
wear shoes. Well sure, it is a good start to a relationship if
they conform to some basic standards but is it really a deal
breaker if they don't? More importantly, is that really the only
thing you would consider before committing to someone?

Cloud computing is a widespread default for current web development
but it is by no means the only way to run web applications. In
some cases it is either not possible to do it due to a myriad of
reasons or the company is in a state of transitioning to cloud.
We should remember that some companies are older than cloud
services and in fact the internet itself. These company may be
considering to make the switch and due to a range of reasons,
it has simply not happened yet.

I would say that using cloud computing is not the only thing to
consider but there is thought worth considering. Cloud computing
is more or less the norm for modern development today. This is
significant for your market value as a software developer.
Your value is closely related to your knowledge of developing
software with the tools used by the industry. This is a thought
you should always keep with you when choosing where to work.
Ideally you want to work with projects that gives you exposure
to the technology that is most in demand.

## What Interesting Problems Do You Solve Daily As A Developer?

I am not sure it meets the criteria of interesting but I would
say, streamlining. Every single day I sit for hours and try to
understand how I can cut wasted time from all kinds of areas.
I like to express what programmers do as, trying to take a
process and convert it to a virtual version of itself. Once
that is done, we spend all our time trying to figure out how
we can make this process as effective as possible. It is in
a way how I imagine mathematicians feel when they break down
something in to equations. Once that is done, they can start
trying to figure out all kinds of improvements or answer
questions related to the domain they are working in.

Being a programmer has an effect on your way of thinking.
After a while you start to care about naming things well,
even outside your code. For some reason you spend time trying
to figure out the best way to make everyday tasks streamlined.
More than once, I have found myself feeling joy when I figured
out a better way to store my things so they don't get in the
way when I clean. I can be high on that for hours.

Most of the time, I find that the job shapes my mind to work
with abstract concepts very well. I often see programmers
forget that not everyone around them has their way of thinking.
To us it feel natural to break down large problems in to smaller
ones and then order them in cadence of dependencies. This way of
thinking serves us well in our work and outside of it, if you
ask me at least. I advice all developers to think about how you
tackle problems in code even outside of your work, there are a
lot of benefits of that way of thinking in everyday life and
you will be surprised how often people around you will appreciate
your input.

## How To Identify If A Developer Is Overqualified For A Team?

I look at two things when I pick a developer for a team.
First, what type of system is the team working on. This is
of paramount importance and the most underestimated factor
managers overlook. Systems may all use code but the level
of complexity and the dynamics of the development process
can vary vastly. If this is not accounted for you easily
end up putting a junior on a senior level project or you
hire a senior who need a lot of direction for a project
that requires them to just go with their gut and do things
based on their own judgement.

Once I know what type of system I am hiring for, I can look
at the developers skill level and their personality.
I argue to my managers that for an average project, it is
a waste to put a top notch developer. They are so rare that
unless the project is in dire need of top notch skills, it
is better to place them on something high stakes or put them
in a product development team support role. Think staff engineer
or similar roles.

So how do we know if they are overqualified? Simple, talk
to them. In an interview you will quickly see what their
technical depth is and how they manage their self learning,
if you ask the right questions. Combine this experience with
your knowledge of the projects needs and you will get a good
feeling for their fit for the team.

The second thing to consider is the social dynamics of the team.
If you underestimate this you will end up with a lot of frustration
and problems in the team. Start by considering the current team
and the types of personalities you are dealing with. Two classic
mismatches is when you have a team of average developers who for
the most part are fine with keeping a good enough quality level
and then you put in a high energy, ambitious and strongly opinionated
developer. Trouble is just a matter of time. The frustration usually
comes from that the new developer feels frustration over the lack of
enthusiasm from their peers and the peers find their sticking their
nose in everyone's business, irritating.

The other case is when the roles are reversed and you put a mellow
type of developer, who prefers to work in a team where there are
processes in place that let them focus on their area without having
to take on a lot of extra responsibilities, in a team with highly
social developers. More than once, I have heard about cases where
the team wants to mob code all the time and feeling disheartened
that some team mates really don't want to work that way. Who is
to say what is right, but I hope we can agree that it is hard to
create a productive work environment when the team members are
too far apart in how they want to do work.

By knowing the project and the team you can usually figure out
what impact a new candidate will have.

## Why Do Most Programming Jobs Require Tool Knowledge?

Because you won't produce any value without them. Programming
has no value unless the code can be used by an end user. To
make that happen you will need tools outside of the programming
language you pick to write your program in.

In most larger development projects, it is common practice to
at the very least have some type of delivery pipeline and a
hosting solution for your code. Apart from these you will
most of the time find that cloud services and Agile workflow
tools are used. There is simply no way for you to avoid learning
these if you want to be part of a serious software team today.

The good news is that for the most part, you won't need to know
every little detail about these tools. The main thing is to know
how to be effective at everyday tasks.

We can also expand our scope of what we consider tools. Is Git
a tool? Well yes, it is. As you can imagine you will need to know
it in order to save your changes and do updates to the main codebase.
If you don't know how to do that, it won't matter much if you can write
code, since it will never create any value for anyone.

The best mindset you can have, if you ask me, is to think in terms
of value provided. You need to learn the tools and processes
involved in producing value for users. Without that, your coding skills
don't earn money and you won't get paid. Some parts of the delivery
process you may not need to know because it is someone elses job to
do it for you but the bottom line is still the same. We do what we
do to create value. What we need to know in order to do that changes
over time and can differ from project to project.

## Is Long-term Job Satisfaction In Software Tied To Personal Development?

That is a tricky question. For me, absolutely. However, we should
consider that, although personal growth is at large a human desire,
it may not always be the most important factor in a professional
environment. I have on many occasions had conversations with
developers who felt that their peers did not show enthusiasm
for their ideas about better ways of doing work or new tech to use.
I explained to them that although they may be right about how much
better things would get if the peers changed their ideas of how
to work, it is perhaps not something they are interested in.
For people who are truly engaged and want to work at the bleeding
edge, this seems to be pure blasphemy but let me try to play
devils advocate.

I am sure that if you think about it, you have several things
that you could improve in your daily job. You could probably
spend more time at the gym or read more books or buy better
items for your home. If we follow this idea to it's end you
will at some point, I hope, agree that although this is true,
you are simply not interested in owning the best version of
everything or working out so much that you can compete at a
professional level and so on. In other words, you have a limit
of how much energy you are willing to spend on an area of your
life. Your coworkers are doing exactly the same thing.

You may find the work you do to be something that your team
should pour the most amount of energy in to so that you can
be "the best" at it but for most people it is just a job.
It is a means to make a living. Their energy is likely being
spent on other things than trying to grow as a developer.
Right or wrong, I think we can agree that the average worker
is not trying to be the best at their job, they are simply trying
as hard as they feel is appropriate to live comfortably.

This can be a tough pill to swallow for the achievers of the world.
You may find that you want to push things to be better but the
people around you don't really care about the work as much as you.
This doesn't mean that they don't grow as people. It just means that
they are putting their energy somewhere else. You may wish that they
would put it in to their work but it will save you a lot of frustration
if you can determine if there is a chance for that to happen or if
you should look to spend more time with people who do put a lot of
energy in to growing within the work they do.

## Should You Consider Scalability For Resume Projects?

No, not at all. Most developers overestimate how much their pet
projects matter to the companies they apply to. If they work with
end customers I can basically promise you that the average customer
will care more about how nice the UI looks than if it runs on a
scalable stack.

The average recruiter won't know what scalability is and frankly, most
don't have the time or skills to deep dive in to a candidates personal
projects. Most people struggle to read the details in a meeting invite,
so I can say with a fair amount of certainty that you won't see them
dive in to the details of your project. There are of course people
who do but it is not the norm.

I advice developer to treat their resume projects as a shop owner treats
their shop window. The key to hooking a customer is to put a nice sign
up and put eye catching items in the window. Treat your projects the
same way. Front the appeal of the project and don't overestimate how
much technical details matter. Most recruiters will be swayed more
by how the project looks and what the main tools are than if you
wrote unit tests or if you have checked the security posture.

## In Top Companies, Would You Still Understand Tech Under The Hood?

Of course, source code is still source code. Depending on the complexity
of the project, there may be  a lot of code or specific logic that
is hard to grasp but it is not magic. If you speak your native language
do you wonder if you will be understood if you spoke to someone who
is better at it? Sure, they may have to explain some words if they
are outside of your vocabulary but on average you should be able
to hold a conversation.

## Can A Junior Developer Be Promoted Over A Senior Developer?

In general, no. There is one exception to this rule, at least in
so far as I can see. The exception is if the senior in question is
lacking the social skills to lead the team. In such a situation a
more junior experience may become the tech lead. However, this may
not in itself mean that the junior has more authority. It simply
means that they will be expected to perform tasks the include
leadership and facilitation. Hosting the standup, speaking to
stakeholders and so on. These are tasks that anyone can do, with the
right level of social skills but it is not everyone who is interested
or able to do it well enough to meet the needs of the company.

Promotions in software usually work on a combination of talent for
the craft and years of experience. In other words, it is possible for
a junior to be better than a senior but it can be tough to get promoted
just because of that fact. This is something that, as you can imagine,
does not sit well with a lot of us. Myself included. It is a bias that
I argue, lives on from the value system our species has had for so
long that it is hard to know when it started. The idea I am referring
to is that you are worth something due to some other factor than what
you are able to do for the world. This means more or less than being
part or royalty, being a boss or just someone who is seen as higher
in status, needs to be catered to in order for everyone to get along.
Because of this, your manager can't rightly promote you higher than
someone who is senior, mostly due to that it looks bad and can stir
up trouble. People believe that due to the senior having more years,
they are entitled to some consideration in this area.

I would love to say that you can fight this but I suspect it will be
a lie. Your best hope is to prove your value, get a good relationship
with your manager and be patient. Even if you may find it hard to get
the title "senior" before you have earned enough years, you will still
benefit from being a good developer. Salaries and similar usually have
a range and top performers usually earn a bit more regardless of what
experience level they are placed in.

## Do Principal Engineers Have The Same Coding Skills As Seniors?

Yes, more often than not. The main difference is usually that the senior
is mostly spending their time coding whereas for principal's they
can have a range of tasks. Most of them involve leadership, meetings,
planning and all the fun tasks you can think of that happens outside
of the coding.

In my experience it is usually the case that seniors who become principal's
are placed in that role based on their experience and their social
skills. You can think of the role as the closest thing you can get
to being a manager without having any employees. For a lot of developers
this is as high as you can get while still having the option to code
on a regular basis. It is a bit of a borderland, you can leave the
coding or keep parts of it depending on how the company views the
role but from this point on you will start to drift away from coding
so I urge you to not fall so out of touch that you forget that the
coding is always relevant.

## Have You Worked As A Principal Engineer?

Yes, for several years. The short story is that I started
showing an aptitude for both the technical part of development
and the social part. This combination is what usually is interesting
for manager looking to promote developers to the principal level.

Once I got the role I am happy to say that a lot of the time I spent
learning how to speak in front of people, present my ideas and of course,
the time I invested in learning about all manner of programming languages,
tools and practice, payed of. Big time.

In my experience the true desire of any IT organization is to find
leaders who are true nerds about tech and who knows how to inspire
other developers to follow their ideals. I will not go as far as
to say that you need to create followers but you benefit a lot from
knowing how to connect with people. If you combine strong soft skills
with even stronger tech skills you have the perfect unit of a leader
in software development. A person who can relate to the developers,
champion topics that are important to them but at the same time
understand how to talk to non technical stakeholders and build
the needed trust and understanding.

Being a principal engineer is like having one foot in each part of
the development process. If you know your tech and you know how to
connect with people, you will do well. At least if you ask me.
