## Does Switching Programming Jobs Get Easier Over Time?

Yes but only if you master the craft of programming instead of
just one stack. There are plenty of developers who have worked
for many years and fail to learn how to code well in any stack,
they are lost without the tools they learned first. These developers
are the ones who are most impacted by layoffs and shifts in the market.
Their value is mostly based on the popularity of a specific tool or
a given work environment.

The developers who find switching jobs the simplest are usually the
ones who learn that a tech stack can change but the core concepts are
almost always the same. Backend developers all know that in todays
modern stack there will always be things like package managers,
web frameworks, databases and test runners. Frontend developers know
that there will be some form build tools involved and so on.

The tools will differ but the process is the same and in fact it gets
easier the more times you switch. Each time you bring previous
knowledge with you and then you do the thing you did from the first
day, you look up what you don't know. That is the big secret to lifelong
growth. Try to do something you don't know and then search for answers.
Don't tell anyone this, it is a well guarded trade secret.

Knowing how to figure out the answers to your questions is the most
important skill a developer can have.

## What About Job Hopping During A Recession?

I don't consider recession times to be much of a factor when job hopping.
It is always a question of how in demand your skills are. So far I
see companies hire and fire people regardless of the economic predictions
made by economists. Granted, the scale may differ but it does not change
my personal strategy for job security.

The practice I preach is to do the following.

- Keep your coding & social skills up to date
- Keep an eye on current trends
- Work on projects that grow your experience
- Have a relevant CV

These practices are in my view, ever-green and regardless of the market,
they will determine your market value. Recessions and booms impacts
companies differently but the skills listed here are always what is
most relevant for software professionals looking for work.

## Is Political Savvy Necessary For Career Growth In It?

To a point, yes. Tech skills will only get you so far before
you hit a wall. That wall is going to be mostly down to
your relationships in the company and your social skills
when dealing with common administrative tasks.

If we start with the most basic way the average company
looks at your value we should be able to agree on a few
things. First, the money you are payed as a pure software
developer is intended for coding. Plain and simple.
However, once you want to change that you will need to
either move to another position similar to the one you
have or you will need to convince your boss that they
will get their moneys worth if they have you do more
than just coding. In essence, the savvy part of this
is to convince your boss to agree with whatever new
position or responsibilities you want.
This is where your relationship building has the most
impact. I would even argue that the most overlooked
skill for software developers is the ability to make
a persuasive argument. Often I coach junior developers
who never get to do what they want due to a difference
in opinion between them and some senior developer or
manager. I ask them to understand that the problem is
not that their coding is bad. The problem is that they
can't convince the person they need to agree that they
know what they are doing. This is the most fundamental
skill of anyone who has ever had an idea that needed
buy in from someone else.

Once you have learned that your relationship with the
people in your company dictates a lot about what changes
you can suggest, the next part comes. Social skills.

In order to get social skills that will help you get
your ideas heard, you need to learn how to present
your idea. This is in theory easy but in reality it
depends a lot on what you are proposing and to who.
I will suggest two different approaches I have found
to work well but before I do, I feel I need to also
tell you that none of this matters if people are
emotionally against you. What I mean is that no matter
how great your idea or how worthy you are of promotion,
it will not happen if people dislike you or if they have
already decided that they prefer how things are working.
This is the toughest pill to swallow for developers who
want to innovate. You may be in a company where they do
not want to change. The prefer it the way it is. I like
to think about it like being a car salesman. If you try
to sell a car to someone who loves their old rust-bucket,
you will probably fail. It is better for you to find a
customer that is in the market for something different
than it is for you to hit a brick wall built on emotional
preferences. It is a far easier task to promote change to
people who are willing to try something different than it
is to force your will on people who don't want change.

My first approach is to ask, who am I trying to persuade?
If it is a technical person the only thing I do after
proposing my suggestion is to ask, "would it be ok if I
made a pull request to show a small example of how my
idea could work?". This is the fastest way for you to
get away from theoretical discussion about best practices
and get really specific about what you want them to consider.

If I am dealing with a non technical person it is a bit tricky
to just write some code and show. Here I have found that the
most useful skill to have is the mannerisms of a professional.
The social skills I am referring to are those of someone who
knows how to do a presentation in a clean and effective way.
With a bit of practice you should be able to fluently explain
what you idea is and motivate it with good arguments. The key
thing to understand is the same as for anyone who ever sold
something. Make sure the arguments you present seem to benefit
the person you are talking to. Build your suggestion on arguments
that talk about cost, quality, development velocity and so on.

To summarize. Politics are overrated if you ask me. The people
who get the furthest are those who know how to connect with the
people who they need on their side in order to get their ideas
going. If you can master how to showcase your skills and how to
make people see the value in your ideas, you will go far.
