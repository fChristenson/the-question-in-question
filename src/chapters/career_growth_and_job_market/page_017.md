## Why do large companies hire so many developers?

Few people outside the industry understand how much
it takes to produce their favorite digital products.
To be fair minded we should also acknowledge that not
every person hired in software development is always
a critical part of the delivery but more on that later.
A friend once asked me if I would be willing to build
him something similar to Facebook. I would of course be
payed for the work and he figured that a free pizza would
be adequate compensation. This is roughly the price of one
favour among friends, just as how that one time I helped him
move his apartment. In response to this generous offer I had
a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. At first I felt tired,
just really tired. I understood that I will never reach this
man. I will never make him truly understand that the files
on his computer can in some cases cost as much as his house,
if not more, to develop. Then I felt that this could be a bit
fun so I roughly calculated how many pizzas I would charge to
build something like Facebook. In the end we agreed that that
was simply too much pizza for me to eat.

This little story of mine is one example of how many view work
that they have a hard time fundamentally understanding the value
of. Most know that IT companies make billions but they don't really
know how or what it takes to make those billions. They just want some
of it and if they can just find one of those programmers they have
heard about, they too could come up with an app idea that will make
that sort of money.

Usually large scale development takes a long time and several people
to develop. How fast you deliver is impacted mostly by the talent of
your people and the size of the system. For a small company, that is
their greatest strength and for a large one it is their most common
weakness. When you have dozens of systems and hundreds of features
you will find that in order to ship on a regular basis you will need
to align multiple teams of people. That means managers for hiring,
product owners for deciding on what to make, finance people to approve
budgets and the list goes on and on.

The thing that is less likely to dawn on the average person is that
large companies have been around enough to build up a size where it
is hard to fully grasp how it all works. Most often you will see a
corporate worker zone out and become slightly apathetic to all the
processes, alignment meetings and plethora of emails with vaguely
relevant information. Once this starts to settle in at large, it
becomes more and more likely that projects go over budget, systems
get built by people who may not have the needed skills to do it well
and entire company structures are made by managers who barely understand
how it all fits together. In short, company hire a lot of people because
there is a lot of work to do and once the company grows large enough
you struggle to keep track of it all.

## Is developer compensation proportional to productivity?

To some extent, yes. However, it is worth mentioning that your
own ideas of what compensation is adequate for what type of productivity
can be different from what the person paying you thinks.
This is a fancy way of saying that your boss may not care at all about
what you think is good work and will pay someone who never writes
any unit tests more simply because they are faster. You and I know
that faster does not mean better but luckily for them, checking who
causes legacy code is less likely to be an activity that the
managers does while checking who delivers on time is.

You compensation is primarily decide by two factors. Years of experience
and word of mouth. In other words, if you are a junior you will most
likely not earn as much as a senior even if you are better than them.
If you are lucky you have a manager who knows enough to spot who is
and who is not a strong contributor in the development teams but don't
bet on this being the norm. The second factor, word of mouth, is at
least as important as your experience. Your manager is not in the pull
requests, checking your commits. They ask your coworkers what they
think about you to determine how valuable you are to the company.

If you want to earn as a developer it is vital that you understand
how to market your skills well and how to build a personal brand in
your company. That brand should be noticeable by both fellow developers
and non technical managers. Both these groups determine how far you
go and how much you earn.

## How to Determine If a Company Follows Good Software Practices?

Experience and tools, my friend. More often than not you will find
that after working for a few years in a few different companies,
there seems to be a red thread. You can't quite place it at first
but it is almost as if you have a sixth sense for what choices the
developers have made before seeing the code. You start being able
to read between the lines when the managers say that they care
about quality. You have heard that before and it usually means
that quality is important as long as we never have to slow down
to fix legacy. Congratulations my friend, you are now a senior
software developer. You are now able to draw upon prior experiences
where similar tools and practices have been part of your life and
you know roughly how they work. You also know that what people say
and what they do is not always the same so you take things that
sound too good to be true with a pinch of salt.

Your best tools for figuring out good practices in the interview
is to know enough about the norms in the industry. This experience
makes it easy to sort of derive what the situation looks like
based on simply knowing what the developers are working with.
This will of course not be a perfect picture but the better you
know how teams do their work and what type of people they write
code for, the better you will get at estimating what is true
and what is not as true when you ask about practices in an
interview or similar.

My favorite question to ask is "can you tell me how you deliver
software?". I make sure that they tell me what libraries they use,
what hosting setup they have and how they plan work.
This gives me the best idea of what my life as a developer will
look like if I start working with this specific group of people.
The rest is down to personal chemistry. If the people you talk
to are engaged and ready to nerd out about coding practices
you will probably be able to guess how they will respond to good
practices as opposed to if they can barely talk about what current
trends are going on in their own stack.

## Do Senior Developers See Patterns When Solving Problems?

Naturally, however it may not be the type of patterns you have
read about in design pattern books. Usually the key difference
between a mid level developer and a senior developer is experience.
It is worth stating that I have so far not been able to draw a
conclusive line between the coding skill of a mid level developer
and a senior developer. It is in my view almost impossible to say
how much difference there is between a mid level and senior developer
in terms of coding skill, assuming that something like that can be
measured accurately. I argue that the thing that determines seniority
is not if the developer is amazing at solving competitive coding problems
or similar coding challenges but rather if they have faced problems
similar to the one they have at the moment.

Once a developer has worked for long enough the daily grind becomes
mostly repetition of things that you have already done. In the start
you can imagine your learning as a line that keeps on going forever.
Everything is new so you learn something each day. However, after a
while you start to get tasks that are the same as what you have done
before. This is when the line starts to loop on itself. At first the
extra repetition is good for you since it helps you embed your
existing knowledge but after a while you simply repeat the same
process over and over.
This is the state where you have reached a proficiency level high
enough that you know what to almost without being able to explain
it. In fact this is a common problem for seniors, they know exactly
what to do but the rest of the team may not. I have on many occasions
talked to seniors who feel annoyed at that they have to write story
cards and show how they intend to solve problems that they already
know how to solve in their head. They know what to do before the
planning is even over because they have done similar things so many
times. Be careful however, just because they have done it many times
does not mean that they do it well or that in fact this time everything
is exactly as it has been in the past.

## What About Job Hopping During a Recession?

I don't consider recession times to be much of a factor when job hopping.
It is always a question of how in demand your skills are. So far I
see companies hire and fire people regardless of the economic predictions
made by economists. Granted, the scale may differ but it does not change
my personal strategy for job security.

The practice I preach is to do the following.

- Keep your coding & social skills up to date
- Keep an eye on current trends
- Work on projects that grow your experience
- Have a relevant CV

These practices are in my view, ever-green and regardless of the market,
they will determine your market value. Recessions and booms impacts
companies differently but the skills listed here are always what is
most relevant for software professionals looking for work.

## Are the First Years of a Developer’s Career the Most Transformative?

I would say so. I argue that the main reason for the average company
wanting at least 5 years work experience from a candidate is precisely
because that is roughly the time they need to become an asset.
You and I know that this idea is not entirely as clear cut as that
but it is never the less something managers practice and there is at
least a grain of truth in it.

When you start your career as a software developer, you know next to
nothing. It is natural that you will feel a bit out of your depth
and early on you will learn a lot about the basics. However, I argue
that there are a few transformation worth being aware of that gives
a bit if nuance. First of all, going from never having a job as a
software developer to someone having one is of course a transformation.
This is the main one that companies hiring developers are aware of
and it is common to believe that it happens after around 5 years.
I argue however, that there are at least 2 more that will happen.

The second transformation happens when you learn that coding is
one part of your job and the other is people. You learn that there
is a bunch of people who you need to align with in order to even
write any code. You have stakeholders, teammates, project owners
and tons of meetings before you get to do any work on the code.
After a while you start to learn how important that part is for
the end result. If this part works poorly you quickly find that
your system goes to shit and nobody likes their work anymore.

The third transformation only happens once you reach true
seniority if you ask me. This is when you learn that code
is about business value and that the goal is to make the
choices needed to delivery the right type of system.
This means that you now know what Agile work practices
are good to use, what tech stack to pick and how to talk
to the people who are involved in the project so everything
goes smoothly. This is when you start looking at your code
as something that is just there to deliver on some goal and
it is no longer a goal in of itself.

## Does switching programming jobs get easier over time?

Yes but only if you master the craft of programming instead of
just one stack. There are plenty of developers who have worked
for many years and fail to learn how to code well in any stack,
they are lost without the tools they learned first. These developers
are the ones who are most impacted by layoffs and shifts in the market.
Their value is mostly based on the popularity of a specific tool or
a given work environment.

The developers who find switching jobs the simplest are usually the
ones who learn that a tech stack can change but the core concepts are
almost always the same. Backend developers all know that in todays
modern stack there will always be things like package managers,
web frameworks, databases and test runners. Frontend developers know
that there will be some form build tools involved and so on.

The tools will differ but the process is the same and in fact it gets
easier the more times you switch. Each time you bring previous
knowledge with you and then you do the thing you did from the first
day, you look up what you don't know. That is the big secret to lifelong
growth. Try to do something you don't know and then search for answers.
Don't tell anyone this, it is a well guarded trade secret.

Knowing how to figure out the answers to your questions is the most
important skill a developer can have.

## How can developers build the confidence to make a career move?

Start by checking your market value. This may seem obvious but
it is often our mental model of what is true is a bit out of
alignment with the world around us. This is how you get some
who believe that everything about them is great and some who
seem to feel the opposite.

How do I know my market value, you ask. Well, it is simple.
Start by looking over your CV, make it nice and presentable.
Update a few things, put a stock photo of you doing something
respectable as your profile picture and then when you feel good
and ready, apply for jobs. Practice applying for jobs by checking
how close your skills are to those in demand. Practice applying
for jobs by seeing if you can handle an interview. If you fail
to get any callbacks, your market value is low.

So how do we fix it? Easy, develop your skills in the tools that
are in demand, learn how to do an interview and practice.
You may never feel comfortable changing your career but
the closest you can get to confidence in it is by feeling the
gap being narrow enough that it is worth to take a risk.

## How to Balance Team Specialization With Generalist Skills in Development?

The answer lies in what type of system you are making. There is a flaw
the reasoning about being a specialist or being a generalist I would
like to point out. If we intend to reach the peak of something such
as becoming the worlds top marathon runner, then we do need to focus
our efforts on a narrow area to reach that goal. However, if we intend
to be the worlds top investor we will need to learn a range of things
in order to develop an ability to analyze markets, earn capital to
invest and so on. The same is true for software engineering and in
fact any engineering if you ask me. We have tasks that need someone
who is a true master of a narrow area and then we have more general
tasks that require less specialization. Which you need depends on the
system.

Once we know if our system has features that need developers of above
average skill we can figure out how to staff our team. The tricky part
here is to know when we are making a system like this and for those
of us who have not worked for many years with a range of developers,
what is average skill? I argue that to find the right team composition
you need to start with what the average workday will look like.
If you intend to make a system that works with some basic CRUD features
on some basic business requirements, then you will probably only need
to consider getting people who can manage a basic DevOps workflow.
However, if we are making a system that will have for example Machine
learning analytics built in to the overall CRUD features, then we need
to ponder adding someone who is specialized in that area since we more
or less know that we won't be able to find someone who can do that
part and the DevOps work on top of it.

As a good rule of thumb I suggest you ask yourself if you have any
features that require specialist knowledge. Most of the time you don't
so getting people who are a bit broader is a good bet. If you find
that you need someone with more in depth knowledge you can add them
later. Just make sure that you understand what areas of the system
will be manageable for a developer with a broader profile and what
areas requires a specialist. It is often easier to split work in to
the overall system development and a niche area. Taking the example
of Machine learning again. You probably want the generalists to build
the CRUD system which is perhaps 80% of the codebase and the model
you are making to analyze the data with is perhaps only 20% but those
are some damn hard 20% to make, so you hire people who are great at
that.

## What Are the Best Practices for Conducting Technical Interviews?

If you ask me, a personal interview and some basic code test.
I am not a fan of big coding challenges and lord knows I have had
some truly bizarre tests that took several days to complete. Frankly
speaking, I believe that the reason for these sorts of test is due
to how laughably ignorant managers in IT companies are of the craft
and the skills needed to excel at it.

My base argument is this. The code test has merit due to that if you
don't have one you will need to allocate time to every single candidate
that applies. That is perhaps not a practical use of your time since
some of them will not have even basic skills. So what to do?
I suggest you create a basic test that reflects your tech stack so
that you can get some sense of if the candidates are able to develop
a junior level application with the tools you need them to use.
This means that you can screen for people who at least have the basic
skills needed and save some time.

Once you know that it is worth having an interview with the person,
it is time to ponder if you have the skills needed to do an effective
interview. I argue that this is where the bulk of information about
the candidates seniority is found but in order to know what questions
to ask, you need to know the trade. For a fellow developer it is easy
to hear if someone has used the tools they use and at about what level
they are in their career right now.

## What Are the Risks of Neglecting Developer Onboarding Processes?

Simply put, they won't be able to ship any code. Code is money,
or at least that is what seems to be what people believe, so the
longer it takes the developer to ship the more the cost is to the
company. I have a standing argument with FinOps enthusiasts and
managers about cost when dealing with system development.
Based on the systems I have worked on, it is clear that the
most expensive part of software development is paying the developer.
No amount of micro tuning machines or doing Agile work practices
will save the amount of money it will cost to ignore the developers
ability to ship code.

Most business owners I know agree that the salaries are often
the main cost they pay and yet somehow we seem to forget that
when it is time to figure out how to make someone productive.
No Agile coach I have worked with has been able to show me
how their rituals have improved delivery speed but I have never
seen an onboarding tutorial with a simple step by step flow
fail to get a developer on track. Yet we seem to always have
a standup in place and hardly ever a document with some basic
getting started instructions.

The main risk we face when we ignore onboarding is the same
one we face when we due to convenience ignore a lopsided team
where a few people know everything and the rest know nothing.
We risk loss of productivity and we risk loss of knowledge
that may be vital to us.

## How Long Does It Take to Measure a Developer’s Caliber?

It depend a bit on the person but usually a few weeks
for a senior and a few months for a junior is where I
start forming an opinion. This has mostly to do with
personal experience and it is in no way a science that
can be broken down to more than watching a lot of people
do the same sort of tasks with varying results.

After a while you start to notice where the normal
weak spots are for the average developer and then
you get a sort of baseline to evaluate against.
For example, I know that most frontend developers
will struggle to optimize the build pipeline so
noticing that this is an area they are a bit slow
in, is expected. However, should I notice that they
struggle with getting a CSS layout right, then my
red flag is raised. Under normal circumstances I
don't make much of a fuzz over finding a few red
flags during my time working with someone. Who
knows, they may be great at other things or they
may be a bit nervous. There are a ton of reasons
that can explain someone having poor performance
when they first start and that is why it takes a
bit of time to evaluate someone if you ask me.
We need to get passed what can be explained as
just being new on the job before I at least,
feel I can estimate someones abilities.

## Do You Need to Be a Genius to Succeed in IT?

No not at all. You need to be able to focus for
long periods of time. You need to be able to
figure out why something isn't working and fix
it but be a genius? No.

Most developers are just regular people who are
no more brilliant than anyone who took the time
to take on an extended education. The top developers
as is true for many profession, are certainly gifted
and a word such as "genius" could apply but that
is not the norm.

## Do You Research IT Companies Before Interviews?

A bit but not that much. The main reasons for that
is that I personally can't figure out what I want
to know about the company without speaking to
the people who work there first. Sure, a bit of
basic information about the company can be found
but what I really care about is what type of
work life I can expect when I start.

I have found that most of the work is the same
wherever you work. There are of course variations
in people, values and details but I have so far
never worked in a company where I felt that there
was something unexpected about the daily job.

With this insight comes something that I can use
when I am looking for work. A pattern. Patterns
are nice because they allow us to glimpse a bit
in to the future. We get a sense of what is likely
to happen. In an interview I use this knowledge by
simply asking about the tools, rituals and type of
project I will work with. Since I know that if a
company uses a stack I am familiar with, there is
a high chance that they have the same setup and
the same workflow, I can predict what the code
looks like and what possible issues they have.

There is no way for me to be certain about what
my work life will look like but at so far my
intuition has been fairly accurate.

## Are Biases an Issue in Software Recruitment?

Oh dear God, yes. There is not a single interviewer
who doesn't inject their own ideas of what a "good"
software developer is, nor could we expect anything
less, if you ask me. I would even go as far as to say
that it is a given that we color candidates in the
shade of our ideas when we speak to people. Luckily
enough, this does not have to be an issue if we are
smart about it. We can after all use a bit of personal
reflection and be honest about what we should be on the
lookout for when we make assessments of a candidates
abilities.

As a rule, I try to have at least 2 people doing the
interview. This is by no means a foolproof way to
remove biases from the equation but it does mitigate
them a bit. The tricky part after is to discuss the
viewpoints of each interviewer without the social
game shifting peoples opinions. The social game in
this context is in my view how the dynamics of the
group shift based on their relationship with each
other. If you have people who share the same values
they will often reach a unified opinion about the
candidate. However, if that group have a strong bias
you will find that they staff your company with people
who are just like them. This can be great if they are
paragons of whatever you want in your teams but if
they are small friction machines who cause all manner
of issues, you will get more people who solidify that
behavior in the company. They may not hire people like
them but they will hire people who allow them to keep
their ways of working.

If you have interviewers with a strong influence over
the others, I suggest you add someone to the discussion
of hiring the candidate who can act as a bit of a social
buffer. Usually people with strong opinions will trample
those who prefer to go with the flow and in such cases
you are best of by adding someone who ensures that each
person can express their ideas and helps them by asking
them why they feel how they feel about the candidate.
This is often enough to deal with major biases.

The most important lesson I have learned about biases
in interviews is to ask myself, "can this person do the
job I am asking them to do?". This was something I did
not understand until later in my career but it changed
my way of looking at the craft. As a die hard programming
fanatic, I of course had a lot of ideas about what good
code was and what good programmers looked like. It was
only later that I started to understand that if I
expected each and every candidate to be a open source
maintainer with their own string of tech talks, I would
never hire anyone. Funnily enough, I never reflected on
that the coworkers I already had where perfectly capable
of shipping working code to production without all these
merits that I felt were proof of skill.
It then dawned on me that perhaps I have forgotten the
main question when hiring someone for a job. After all,
if we look at sports for example. There are many people
who play sports at different levels and we may look to
the top league players when we think about what good
players look like. However, we all know that even if
they may be the ideal, we can still have a lot of fun
at the lower levels. The same is true for working.
There are products that require people of top level
talent to make but on average you simply need someone
who is good enough to do the job. Our society would
not function if each and every position could only
be filled by someone we perceive as a top level
performer.

When I understood that my bias was to only hire people
who where as extreme about their passion for programming,
I shifted my way of thinking to trying to figure out where
the passing grade was. Instead of trying to figure out if
the candidate was a top performer, I simply asked myself
what they need to fit in without issue. I found that so
far this strategy helped me a lot in hiring some great
people. The code is getting shipped and it mostly works,
so the true goal of hiring someone has been accomplished.

## Is political savvy necessary for career growth in IT?

To a point, yes. Tech skills will only get you so far before
you hit a wall. That wall is going to be mostly down to
your relationships in the company and your social skills
when dealing with common administrative tasks.

If we start with the most basic way the average company
looks at your value we should be able to agree on a few
things. First, the money you are payed as a pure software
developer is intended for coding. Plain and simple.
However, once you want to change that you will need to
either move to another position similar to the one you
have or you will need to convince your boss that they
will get their moneys worth if they have you do more
than just coding. In essence, the savvy part of this
is to convince your boss to agree with whatever new
position or responsibilities you want.
This is where your relationship building has the most
impact. I would even argue that the most overlooked
skill for software developers is the ability to make
a persuasive argument. Often I coach junior developers
who never get to do what they want due to a difference
in opinion between them and some senior developer or
manager. I ask them to understand that the problem is
not that their coding is bad. The problem is that they
can't convince the person they need to agree that they
know what they are doing. This is the most fundamental
skill of anyone who has ever had an idea that needed
buy in from someone else.

Once you have learned that your relationship with the
people in your company dictates a lot about what changes
you can suggest, the next part comes. Social skills.

In order to get social skills that will help you get
your ideas heard, you need to learn how to present
your idea. This is in theory easy but in reality it
depends a lot on what you are proposing and to who.
I will suggest two different approaches I have found
to work well but before I do, I feel I need to also
tell you that none of this matters if people are
emotionally against you. What I mean is that no matter
how great your idea or how worthy you are of promotion,
it will not happen if people dislike you or if they have
already decided that they prefer how things are working.
This is the toughest pill to swallow for developers who
want to innovate. You may be in a company where they do
not want to change. The prefer it the way it is. I like
to think about it like being a car salesman. If you try
to sell a car to someone who loves their old rust-bucket,
you will probably fail. It is better for you to find a
customer that is in the market for something different
than it is for you to hit a brick wall built on emotional
preferences. It is a far easier task to promote change to
people who are willing to try something different than it
is to force your will on people who don't want change.

My first approach is to ask, who am I trying to persuade?
If it is a technical person the only thing I do after
proposing my suggestion is to ask, "would it be ok if I
made a pull request to show a small example of how my
idea could work?". This is the fastest way for you to
get away from theoretical discussion about best practices
and get really specific about what you want them to consider.

If I am dealing with a non technical person it is a bit tricky
to just write some code and show. Here I have found that the
most useful skill to have is the mannerisms of a professional.
The social skills I am referring to are those of someone who
knows how to do a presentation in a clean and effective way.
With a bit of practice you should be able to fluently explain
what you idea is and motivate it with good arguments. The key
thing to understand is the same as for anyone who ever sold
something. Make sure the arguments you present seem to benefit
the person you are talking to. Build your suggestion on arguments
that talk about cost, quality, development velocity and so on.

To summarize. Politics are overrated if you ask me. The people
who get the furthest are those who know how to connect with the
people who they need on their side in order to get their ideas
going. If you can master how to showcase your skills and how to
make people see the value in your ideas, you will go far.

## What If You Took the Wrong Job in IT?

This is highly likely to happen at some point. Mostly due how hard
it is to know what you are actually going to be doing once you start.
The tricky part about developing software is that there are so many
ways to do it. I often find it hard to connect with other developers
since we can come from such different tech stacks. It can at times
be hard to understand each other if our tech jargon doesn't overlap.
However, the good news is that there are some tells of how you figure
out if the job you are about to take is good or not. We should also
consider how we figure out if a job is "good" or not and what to do
if it turns out we want to switch.

First, ask yourself where you are in your career right now? Some of
of us have done work for years and some are just starting. What we
need next my also differ based on our ambitions. What do you want to
be able to do in the future? These are the two main questions you should
ask before taking action.

Once you know what you are looking for, check around. It may be that
you have the opportunity to adjust your work in your current company.
If however, you don't have that option or perhaps the reason for you
not wanting to stay is more than just your personal growth, you are
left with only one option. Go somewhere else. So how do we do that?
I am glad you asked.

Your first move should be to determine your market value. If you want
to be able to have options when looking for work you need to sell what
people are buying. Check the job postings for the sort of companies
you want to work for and figure out what tech they use.
Once you know what your market value is, either start applying for
jobs and/or educate yourself on the tech that is new too you.
During this period I find that it is a great idea to look at your current
work as payed learning. Make sure you pick the tasks that will grow
your skills. In fact, you should always be doing this if you ask me.

## How to Pass the Trial Period at a New Job?

The trial period is not something that you will face in all companies.
It is a practice employed in different ways in different regions of
the world but the core concept is often the same. The company has some
type of evaluation period when hiring a new developer. During this
period they will look at how well the developer fits in the company.
There may be legal aspects to consider for them as well depending on
the labour laws so this period can be extra important.

The suggestions I usually make are:

- Smile
- Increase positive communication by 40%
- Be an active learner
- Learn your environment before you change it

These tips will get you most of the way through. It goes without saying
I hope that having the skills needed to meet expectations is vital
but I argue that it isn't really productive to suggest what can't be
actively worked on. You can after all not magically become better than
you are without practice and practice is something you should already
be doing or you should at least be confident in that you have the skills.

Let's elaborate a bit on this list of mine. First, smiling is a given
I hope. During this period your social skills will factor in just as
your tech skills so a good impression will help you. Second, learn
how to communicate in a positive manner and how to give suggestions
on improvements without sounding too critical. It may feel better
to be able to vent frustration in a satisfying way but you may end
up sending the wrong message. Third, make sure you don't just sit
and wait for others to give you an onboarding. You are better off
showing that you are there to get up to speed. Ask relevant questions
so you can get your work environment up. Make sure you note important
practices and documents. Lastly, make sure you take the time to
understand how your coworkers view their environment. Even if you may
have the best suggestions and love the craft more than anyone, they
may feel differently. Even if you know that things could be better,
remember that you may be working with people who care less than you.
If that is the case and you start pointing out all the flaws you see
without being careful, you may start pissing people off.
Even if you are right it will not matter if the people you work with
don't care about improving. This is a tough pill to swallow for some
but the best way I can describe it is by an example.

Imagine that you want to play football and then you join a local
team of amateurs. Now lets say you feel that your team should be
aiming to play as best as you can and you start pushing the others
to practice more. After a while the rest of the team stop showing
up or you may even get frozen out. So what could be happening?
Well, if they want to just play around casually and have a good time
it will get pretty annoying to have someone who is always nagging them
about working harder. In such a situation the best course of action
is for you to ask if this is the team for you or if you should adapt?

## Is It Okay to Take a Break from Studying Software Development?

I hope this goes without saying but, yes. The main thing is to be
honest about how much effort you are putting in. It can be easy to
make mental investments that are simply too low for you to make
any meaningful progress. I have been learning Spanish for longer
than I care to admit and I can still only speak enough to hold
the simplest of conversations. This is mainly due to that my
investment has been around 15 minutes per day. Clearly, that
is not enough for me to master the language to the level I want.

The same is true for your journey in software development. If
you treat it as a serious effort with a time investment that is
similar to a full time job or going to college, you will see
results. However, if you on and off with the practice you may
never get good enough to do it professionally. That may not be
your goal so just set your expectations correctly.

## Is It a Red Flag If a Candidate Lacks Specific Experiences?

It depends on the experiences. There are certainly experiences
that are one off in your career and that most of us have never
had to dealt with. However, there are also experiences that almost
all developer have in some way or another had. If a candidate lacks
those we may find it hard to relate to each other and that is often
where red flags are raised. The interviewer will most of the time
draw upon their own ideas of what an experienced software developer
should know and what they should have done so if they lack experience
in these areas of evaluation, they may not get the job.
This of course the most lamented part of the interview by all developers.
Why are they evaluating me on these things?! These are not things that
matter. They should be doing things differently!
I can only sigh and agree in some cases but just as with any evaluation,
be it at test in school, a talent show or a job interview, the judge
dictates what a passing grade is.

## What questions reveal true expertise in an interview?

My argument is that one of the ways people relate to each other is
through shared experiences. In other words, a senior developer will
have gone through similar challenges in some areas that other seniors
have. Here is the tricky part, how do we know what experiences to look
for? This is the main reason I argue that hiring developers should
be done by other developers. It is relatively easy to come up with
some technical questions and figure out if the candidate understands
them but requires experience to figure out what the daily challenges
is for a software developer and how to create questions that prompts
the candidate to respond in a meaningful way.

As my little prelude on this question indicates, I believe that the
most effective way to determine expertise in an interview is by
asking questions related to experience. The main goal is to assert
that the candidate has had hands on experience dealing with many of
the daily tasks a developer faces. I try as much as possible to avoid
asking questions about broad topics such as how their career has looked
or what their values are when I am trying to figure out their seniority
level. These questions can suck up a lot of time in the interview and
a skilled candidate can easily answer such questions without ever really
going in to any details. I much prefer to ask very specific questions
that can be answered regardless of skill level.
If I ask a candidate, "have you worked with any ORM's and why do we
use them?", I know that the answer will need to be specific and it
will help me understand to what level the candidate has worked with
ORM's, in this case. The same approach can be applied to any tool
and my favorite part is to follow up by asking things such as,
"do you see any benefits or issues with using one tool over another?".
This puts the candidate in a spot where they quickly show how much
reflecting they have done on their work and the tools they use.
It is this experience that helps me figure out how they think about
technology and to what extent their decisions are based on experience.
Understanding a candidates way of thinking is a really great way to
get a sneak peak at what type of coworker they will be.

## What About Being a Junior Developer Who Can't Measure Up?

There is reason to sugarcoat it, it sucks.
I have sadly been here as many others. I did not care for it.
However, there is little you can do in the moment. You need
time to develop your skills and that takes however long it
takes. What I like to suggest to developer who go through this
is to find a decent coping mechanism. We all get affected by
troublesome times differently but we all in one way or another
find things that make the journey bearable.

In addition to having things in your life to help you get through
tough work conditions, I can recommend to view all experience as
a net good. The old saying, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger",
comes to mind. It may be little comfort in the moment but I urge you
to use the experiences you are getting, reflect on them and derive
what is useful from them so you at least gain something from the whole
ordeal.

## What Was Your First Job in Software Development Like?

Terrible. Some of the toughest times in my life hands down. I woke
up dreading to go to work on some days and others it was merely a
bit of anxiety that hit me. At the time I was brought in to a firm
that had an idea to developer a salary management system. The idea
was simple, take what was a desktop application and make it a
web application. The company was able to provide me some minor support
by asking one of the original developers of the web application to
assist me when he had time to spare away from his own project.
This turned out to be too little for my needs at the time and as you
can imagine, it did not get better. In the last months of my stay I
was joined by two other partners. These where two university students
who had managed to create a startup with a lot of overlap with the
system I was working on. They joined forces with the firm and I now
had a business developer and another software developer to work with.
Sadly the situation did not improve. In my last months with the
company I got notice that they felt I did not meet expectation.
This came as no surprise to me but I still felt the hit to my confidence.
Being the shaky leaf of insecurities that I am, I was crushed.

Luckily I had been contacted by another company at around the same
time. I took an interview, got an offer and moved on.
At the time it felt like a failure but in hindsight it was one of
the best changes I have made in my career.

## How can hiring managers effectively evaluate CVs and determine seniority?

I suggest you acknowledge if you have the tech background to evaluate
developers or not. This is a bit of an honest moment for some since
we need to accept that although being a manager has many challenges
that grow skills that are important to an organization, this is an
area managers usually don't spend a lot of time in.
It is by far better to collaborate with people who have done the work
for many years so the assessment becomes as accurate as it can be.

The main challenge a manager will face in this scenario is biases
from the developers. If you have inexperienced developers or perhaps
highly opinionated developers, you may find that screening people
becomes a struggle. Poor social skills in the developers can create
further challenges when it comes time to do a personal interview
and worse, you may end up with a team that is incapable of delivering
anything or handle basic communication with stakeholders.

So, what to do? I can recommend that you start by asking yourself
if you have any developers with well developed social skills in
the company. Seniority is of less importance at this stage since
you first want to make sure you have people who have the needed
social skills to handle the interview process. Once you know that
you have people who understand how to communicate well and who
understand the importance of having someone who fits in the company,
you can take the next step.

The next step is to list down the technology tools you use for the
project your are hiring for. Focus on the main tool names that you
usually see on peoples CV's or in job postings from other companies.
This is important since this gives you a checklist of tools a new
candidate should have. Then discuss with the developers you have
brought in to collaborate with. Focus on aligning on determining
what tools are most important so you can put emphasis on the tools
that are most important to your project.

Lastly, I give this advice. Focus on getting a developer who is  good
social fit and knows the main tools. It is really hard for someone
who is a layman in tech to figure out just how good someone is and
more often than not you will end up hiring people who on paper are
good but for some reason you find further down the line that the
project is facing issues. If you hire people who know the tools
and have strong communication skills you, at the very least, have
a good chance to fix things with communication.

## What Is Within the Scope of a Software Engineer After 10 Years?

Potentially everything. The best way I can describe the scope change
for a developer over the years is that the longer you do the job the
higher the expectations go. Don't fret, there is a limit to what people
will expect from you but there is a catch worth knowing about.

The catch is that each company is different. This is the greatest challenge
facing companies when staffing their projects, in my view. You always
need good people but what's worse is that you need people who can handle
your specific stack. For us developers this makes life a lot harder.
Due to the diversity of the stacks on the market we my very well need
to know a significant amount of workflows to confidently be able to
apply for work. I am sure that more than a few people have reflected
on how diverse and lengthy the profiles companies request job applicants
to have can be. This is the fallout of having a large ecosystem of
choices.

I think it is safe to say that the pattern is usually this.
At a junior level you are mostly responsible for knowing the
basics of your stack. Usually you will mostly be focusing on
just getting your deliverables in to production. Once you have
done that for a few years people will expect you to be able to
do an increasing amount of tasks independently. How much more
depends on the company. In some teams there is very little
other than the coding you need to take care of but in others
you may find yourself doing a range of things other than the coding.

The most common things that creep in to your scope are basic DevOps
tasks. These are usually things such as checking system health, logs,
deployments and so on. The best way I can summarize it is, you need
to know the practical tasks that include deploying, running and
debugging your system.

## What About Trainee Developer Positions?

This is can be a great way to get a foothold in the industry.
However, it is worth knowing what to look for before you accept.

On more than a few occasions, I have seen soon to be developers
being put in tough situations where their managers don't understand
that being a trainee means that you need as much, if not more, support
as a junior software developer. Some managers don't account for this
and some blatantly exploit the trainee by using them for adhoc tasks
that doesn't benefit them.

Luckily, I have a few tips for both sides of this. The key issue is
that the trainee lacks experience to just dive in and become productive.
The manager is likely not interested in reducing capacity from their
regular development teams to give support. At least, not until they
have a sense of if they want to keep the trainee or not.
So what to do?

For trainees, I suggest you ask about the work you will be doing once
you take the job. Make sure the manager is specific about it.
Your goal is to get as close as possible to the development done by
the developers already working there. You will benefit the most by
learning from them and you will need support from them to get going.

For managers, I give this advice. I have found that the best way to
get trainees productive and to gain value from their work is by looking
at peripheral projects. These are projects that are usually of lower
complexity than the core systems and they will benefit the company
but they may not be so important that you feel you should take time
from the developers working on the main codebase.
This is a perfect project for a trainee. You give them a real project
that will benefit the company and regardless of how it goes there is
no negative impact on the core projects. This is a low risk investment
that will give both parties a chance to get to know each other.

Trainees usually feel that by being in a low risk project they feel
calmer than if you put them on a big project right away and managers
can feel calm in the knowledge that, there is no risk involved in
the trainees getting a chance to show what they can do.
I believe this sort of setup will encourage more companies to consider
what "nice to have" projects they would like to make and that would
be a good match for new developers who want to try out working for
them.

## What Does It Take to Excel as a Junior Developer?

The obvious answer is to perform well with your coding
and need little to no guidance other than what your
coworkers feel is just the right amount. In theory this
is easy to do but as you can imagine, harder in reality.

My main tips will most of the time be to make sure you
try your best to solve your own issues. Respect the time
of your coworkers but also ask for help when you are truly
stuck. Showing that tiny bit of consideration will go a long
way. The rest is about being friendly, eager to learn and talent.
You can't really control talent but you can be mindful of how
you behave in the workplace and how you interact with your coworkers.
Smiling, showing consideration and engaging in a positive way with
other people can make a huge difference.

## How to Succeed as a Solo Junior Developer?

This is probably the toughest situation you can find yourself
in when you start your career as a programmer. I would advice
against being solo in the beginning but realistically it is hard
to be picky about your workplace before you get a few years in.

The main tip I can give you is to keep it simple. Stick to the
most popular choices in tech so you know there are tons of learning
materials and people who have posted solutions to various problems
online. Leverage AI systems and focus on just making things work.
There is no benefit in you trying to guess what the best solution
looks like and how more senior developers would do something.
Simply check for basic tips that you can apply and accept that
even if the code won't be as perfect as if you had years of
experience, if it works, you get to keep your job and continue
learning. That is the key to becoming senior. Deliver something
that works well enough, learn from it and repeat.
