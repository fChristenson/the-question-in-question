## Why Do Large Companies Hire So Many Developers?

Few people outside the industry understand how much
it takes to produce their favorite digital products.
To be fair minded we should also acknowledge that not
every person hired in software development is always
a critical part of the delivery but more on that later.
A friend once asked me if I would be willing to build
him something similar to Facebook. I would of course be
payed for the work and he figured that a free pizza would
be adequate compensation. This is roughly the price of one
favour among friends, just as how that one time I helped him
move his apartment. In response to this generous offer I had
a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. At first I felt tired,
just really tired. I understood that I will never reach this
man. I will never make him truly understand that the files
on his computer can in some cases cost as much as his house,
if not more, to develop. Then I felt that this could be a bit
fun so I roughly calculated how many pizzas I would charge to
build something like Facebook. In the end we agreed that that
was simply too much pizza for me to eat.

This little story of mine is one example of how many view work
that they have a hard time fundamentally understanding the value
of. Most know that IT companies make billions but they don't really
know how or what it takes to make those billions. They just want some
of it and if they can just find one of those programmers they have
heard about, they too could come up with an app idea that will make
that sort of money.

Usually large scale development takes a long time and several people
to develop. How fast you deliver is impacted mostly by the talent of
your people and the size of the system. For a small company, that is
their greatest strength and for a large one it is their most common
weakness. When you have dozens of systems and hundreds of features
you will find that in order to ship on a regular basis you will need
to align multiple teams of people. That means managers for hiring,
product owners for deciding on what to make, finance people to approve
budgets and the list goes on and on.

The thing that is less likely to dawn on the average person is that
large companies have been around enough to build up a size where it
is hard to fully grasp how it all works. Most often you will see a
corporate worker zone out and become slightly apathetic to all the
processes, alignment meetings and plethora of emails with vaguely
relevant information. Once this starts to settle in at large, it
becomes more and more likely that projects go over budget, systems
get built by people who may not have the needed skills to do it well
and entire company structures are made by managers who barely understand
how it all fits together. In short, company hire a lot of people because
there is a lot of work to do and once the company grows large enough
you struggle to keep track of it all.

## Is Developer Compensation Proportional To Productivity?

To some extent, yes. However, it is worth mentioning that your
own ideas of what compensation is adequate for what type of productivity
can be different from what the person paying you thinks.
This is a fancy way of saying that your boss may not care at all about
what you think is good work and will pay someone who never writes
any unit tests more simply because they are faster. You and I know
that faster does not mean better but luckily for them, checking who
causes legacy code is less likely to be an activity that the
managers does while checking who delivers on time is.

You compensation is primarily decide by two factors. Years of experience
and word of mouth. In other words, if you are a junior you will most
likely not earn as much as a senior even if you are better than them.
If you are lucky you have a manager who knows enough to spot who is
and who is not a strong contributor in the development teams but don't
bet on this being the norm. The second factor, word of mouth, is at
least as important as your experience. Your manager is not in the pull
requests, checking your commits. They ask your coworkers what they
think about you to determine how valuable you are to the company.

If you want to earn as a developer it is vital that you understand
how to market your skills well and how to build a personal brand in
your company. That brand should be noticeable by both fellow developers
and non technical managers. Both these groups determine how far you
go and how much you earn.

## How To Determine If A Company Follows Good Software Practices?

Experience and tools, my friend. More often than not you will find
that after working for a few years in a few different companies,
there seems to be a red thread. You can't quite place it at first
but it is almost as if you have a sixth sense for what choices the
developers have made before seeing the code. You start being able
to read between the lines when the managers say that they care
about quality. You have heard that before and it usually means
that quality is important as long as we never have to slow down
to fix legacy. Congratulations my friend, you are now a senior
software developer. You are now able to draw upon prior experiences
where similar tools and practices have been part of your life and
you know roughly how they work. You also know that what people say
and what they do is not always the same so you take things that
sound too good to be true with a pinch of salt.

Your best tools for figuring out good practices in the interview
is to know enough about the norms in the industry. This experience
makes it easy to sort of derive what the situation looks like
based on simply knowing what the developers are working with.
This will of course not be a perfect picture but the better you
know how teams do their work and what type of people they write
code for, the better you will get at estimating what is true
and what is not as true when you ask about practices in an
interview or similar.

My favorite question to ask is "can you tell me how you deliver
software?". I make sure that they tell me what libraries they use,
what hosting setup they have and how they plan work.
This gives me the best idea of what my life as a developer will
look like if I start working with this specific group of people.
The rest is down to personal chemistry. If the people you talk
to are engaged and ready to nerd out about coding practices
you will probably be able to guess how they will respond to good
practices as opposed to if they can barely talk about what current
trends are going on in their own stack.
