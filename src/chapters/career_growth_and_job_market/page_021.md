## What Are The Risks Of Neglecting Developer Onboarding Processes?

Simply put, they won't be able to ship any code. Code is money,
or at least that is what seems to be what people believe, so the
longer it takes the developer to ship the more the cost is to the
company. I have a standing argument with FinOps enthusiasts and
managers about cost when dealing with system development.
Based on the systems I have worked on, it is clear that the
most expensive part of software development is paying the developer.
No amount of micro tuning machines or doing Agile work practices
will save the amount of money it will cost to ignore the developers
ability to ship code.

Most business owners I know agree that the salaries are often
the main cost they pay and yet somehow we seem to forget that
when it is time to figure out how to make someone productive.
No Agile coach I have worked with has been able to show me
how their rituals have improved delivery speed but I have never
seen an onboarding tutorial with a simple step by step flow
fail to get a developer on track. Yet we seem to always have
a standup in place and hardly ever a document with some basic
getting started instructions.

The main risk we face when we ignore onboarding is the same
one we face when we due to convenience ignore a lopsided team
where a few people know everything and the rest know nothing.
We risk loss of productivity and we risk loss of knowledge
that may be vital to us.

## How Long Does It Take To Measure A Developerâ€™s Caliber?

It depend a bit on the person but usually a few weeks
for a senior and a few months for a junior is where I
start forming an opinion. This has mostly to do with
personal experience and it is in no way a science that
can be broken down to more than watching a lot of people
do the same sort of tasks with varying results.

After a while you start to notice where the normal
weak spots are for the average developer and then
you get a sort of baseline to evaluate against.
For example, I know that most frontend developers
will struggle to optimize the build pipeline so
noticing that this is an area they are a bit slow
in, is expected. However, should I notice that they
struggle with getting a CSS layout right, then my
red flag is raised. Under normal circumstances I
don't make much of a fuzz over finding a few red
flags during my time working with someone. Who
knows, they may be great at other things or they
may be a bit nervous. There are a ton of reasons
that can explain someone having poor performance
when they first start and that is why it takes a
bit of time to evaluate someone if you ask me.
We need to get passed what can be explained as
just being new on the job before I at least,
feel I can estimate someones abilities.

## Do You Need To Be A Genius To Succeed In It?

No not at all. You need to be able to focus for
long periods of time. You need to be able to
figure out why something isn't working and fix
it but be a genius? No.

Most developers are just regular people who are
no more brilliant than anyone who took the time
to take on an extended education. The top developers
as is true for many profession, are certainly gifted
and a word such as "genius" could apply but that
is not the norm.

## Do You Research It Companies Before Interviews?

A bit but not that much. The main reasons for that
is that I personally can't figure out what I want
to know about the company without speaking to
the people who work there first. Sure, a bit of
basic information about the company can be found
but what I really care about is what type of
work life I can expect when I start.

I have found that most of the work is the same
wherever you work. There are of course variations
in people, values and details but I have so far
never worked in a company where I felt that there
was something unexpected about the daily job.

With this insight comes something that I can use
when I am looking for work. A pattern. Patterns
are nice because they allow us to glimpse a bit
in to the future. We get a sense of what is likely
to happen. In an interview I use this knowledge by
simply asking about the tools, rituals and type of
project I will work with. Since I know that if a
company uses a stack I am familiar with, there is
a high chance that they have the same setup and
the same workflow, I can predict what the code
looks like and what possible issues they have.

There is no way for me to be certain about what
my work life will look like but at so far my
intuition has been fairly accurate.

## Do Senior Developers See Patterns When Solving Problems?

Naturally, however it may not be the type of patterns you have
read about in design pattern books. Usually the key difference
between a mid level developer and a senior developer is experience.
It is worth stating that I have so far not been able to draw a
conclusive line between the coding skill of a mid level developer
and a senior developer. It is in my view almost impossible to say
how much difference there is between a mid level and senior developer
in terms of coding skill, assuming that something like that can be
measured accurately. I argue that the thing that determines seniority
is not if the developer is amazing at solving competitive coding problems
or similar coding challenges but rather if they have faced problems
similar to the one they have at the moment.

Once a developer has worked for long enough the daily grind becomes
mostly repetition of things that you have already done. In the start
you can imagine your learning as a line that keeps on going forever.
Everything is new so you learn something each day. However, after a
while you start to get tasks that are the same as what you have done
before. This is when the line starts to loop on itself. At first the
extra repetition is good for you since it helps you embed your
existing knowledge but after a while you simply repeat the same
process over and over.
This is the state where you have reached a proficiency level high
enough that you know what to almost without being able to explain
it. In fact this is a common problem for seniors, they know exactly
what to do but the rest of the team may not. I have on many occasions
talked to seniors who feel annoyed at that they have to write story
cards and show how they intend to solve problems that they already
know how to solve in their head. They know what to do before the
planning is even over because they have done similar things so many
times. Be careful however, just because they have done it many times
does not mean that they do it well or that in fact this time everything
is exactly as it has been in the past.
