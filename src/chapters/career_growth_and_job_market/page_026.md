## How To Convince Your Boss That A Certificate Is A Waste Of Time?

The simplest way is to explain that the certificate is just proof
that you know a topic. If your boss feels that there is value in
having that proof, there is little you can argue for. It is a bit
like trying to argue that you don't need a degree to be good
at something but as most of us can agree, it is hard to fight
against peoples prejudices.

To make a a good case I argue that we should remind ourselves
that there are some who have dropped out of school and gone on
to become immensely successful. However, I argue that the reason
for their success without a degree, is due to their ability to
deliver value. Value is what means something, not the paper you
get when you have graduated.

In other words, show your manager that you know what the certificate
aims to prove. If you know how to create the value you are already
creating the benefit of having an education.

Arguing for that practical skills and creating value is more important
than having a certificate is usually a straightforward dialogue but
if you are up against someone who wants you to get more things to add
to your CV or someone who is less reasonable, you can't win.

My favorite tip in situations like these is to be a lazy employee.
It is a trick as old as management. Make it hard for someone to get
something and they will likely forget about it and move on.
We lovingly call it at times to "kill it by backlog". This means that
we all know that if something isn't very important to the right people
we will just make a backlog item and promise to look at it later. As
you can guess, that part rarely happens. You can do the same here.

## How Can Developers Cultivate The Mindset Of A Senior Engineer?

It is a bit like growing up if you ask me. You start by just playing
with code, trying to make it work. You keep messing up over and over,
until you start to feel pretty good about a few things. After that,
you start building a little confidence and you experiment with new
ways of doing things. Now you start meeting some people who may have
different ideas from your own and you learn how to argue your point
and deal with the frustration of not getting your way. Finally, you
start getting tired of dealing with excess complexity and ineffective
solutions, coworkers and leadership. Congratulations, now you are a
bitter old senior.

The mindset you grow is best described as a mature one.
If you want to start cultivating it early on I can summarize your focus
area like this.

Focus on creating code that is made to make your customer happy.

Why is this so important? I argue that the mark of a true senior is
that they have tried out a range of ways to make software. It is
by doing this they learn when to use one approach over another.
However, there is a category of people who start to forget why they
are making code in the first place. Usually it is to deliver some type
of business value, for us who work as professional developers.
This is an important point because if we forget this, we tend to make
solutions that are overly complex or using tech that may not be the
best fit for the situation.
This is where a senior mindset makes itself known. The trick is to
know through experience what ways there is to solve a given problem
and then pick the one that is best for your customer, not for you.

I have a saying, "understand the problem that you are solving".
This sentence I use to explain what I have been stating in these
paragraphs. As a senior your mind should always be focused on making
the right choice for the given situation. Being able to do that is
only possible by experimenting with different approaches, learning
from them and then being focused on the goal of the project.
Experiment to your hearts content when the time is right but never
forget that your choices in a professional environment, should always
be to benefit the customer.

## What Should You Know Before Applying For An Entry-level Job?

I would say the main things are as follows.

- Make sure your CV is eye catching
- Practice the technologies used in the company
- Be prepared to onboard yourself

Most of the time junior developers are viewed as an investment.
This in practice means that you get picked mostly based on 2 things.
How much potential you show and how well you interact with the people
working at the company.

Your best bet is to make sure your CV is filled with things that prove
that you care about programming. Take extra courses, become an an
amateur influencer, contribute to open source project and the list
can go on and on. The aim is to make your CV stand out. This is how
you get a callback and without a callback you won't get further.

Next comes passing the interview. This will be down to how well you
know your tech and how good you are at social interactions.
You goal is to be able to answer questions related to tech, ideally
tech used in the company. Remember, you don't have to know everything,
you just have to show that you have put real effort in to developing
your skills.

During the interview your social goal should be to leave the interviewer
with a good gut feeling. Although it is an interview and people try
to be objective in their assessments of candidates, most of time who
gets hired is one part experience and one part how the interviewer
felt after.

Lastly, once you start working, your main goal is to get productive
in the most autonomous way you can. Each company is different in how
much support they can give to their developers. This means that your
best strategy is to actively seek out people who can show you what
you need to know in order to become self reliant. The quickest way
to becoming a mid level developer is to know enough to deliver software
without needing to ask for help several times a day. We all need help
at times but you will be better off long term if you use you apply
real effort in to learning how to find answers to your questions
without depending on that your coworkers do the work for you.

## Why Is Having A Career Gap On A Cv Viewed Negatively?

It depends on the gap and the person doing the review. In general
however it is not something that will stand out much. My personal
suggestion is that you view your CV as a record that tells a story
of your professional life. No reasonable person will dismiss a CV
that shows that the candidate has relevant experience, based on a
gap alone. There may be some questions related to the gap or any
other peculiarities but as long as you have a good explanation to
them, you will be fine.
